Despite this, the field still has some way to go to definitively demonstrate this causal relationship; partly due to the cross-sectional nature of much of this research. In the current paper, we give a brief overview of the SHRM field and the benefits that the new subfield of People Analytics (PA) might bring to the area. We also conduct a brief survey of research in Insider Econometrics, an approach used in Personnel Economics to produce empirical estimates of the value of HR practices, to highlight longitudinal intra-firm research in economics that could provide insights to research exploring the HR investment-performance link (important in both SHRM and PA fields). We discuss the value of combining the business impact perspective of People Analytics that has a unique ‘inside’ (intra-firm) position, with the longitudinal intra-firm analysis approaches utilized in Insider Econometrics. We suggest that People Analytics researchers, who are able to draw on the theoretical developments in HRM field, would benefit from exploring existing research insights and methodological techniques used within the field of Insider Econometrics. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","HR analytics; Human resource management; insider econometrics; intrafirm analysis; longitudinal methods; people analytics; personnel economics; strategic human resource management",""

This article introduces the special issue on HR Aanalytics for the HRMJ. Several recent reviews in the area have struggled to find HR analytics research in the published literature and a key aim of this special issue is to show case high quality analytic projects and cutting-edge analytic techniques to contribute to this emerging subfield of HRM. Before considering the papers in the special issue, we reflect on two key challenges in the area: First, HR analytics is not a recognized keyword, this makes it difficult to categorise and identify HR analytics research in the field. Second, there are a growing number of reviews of a field that has a limited range of recognised examples of empirical papers to draw on. We discuss the difficulties and potential political sensitivities for practitioners seeking to publish ‘within firm’ HR analytics projects. We also consider the growing recognition that organisations engaging in HR analytics projects have a range of ethical challenges to deal with going forward. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","ethics; HR analytics; multi-level modelling; people analytics; quantitative data; strategic HRM; textual analysis",""

The objective of this study is to identify and synthesise existing literature on people analytics and its conceptualised efficacy. This is done with a view to assess how and why people analytics enhances HR as a field and elevates it to a function of strategic significance. The study uses the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) framework for systematic literature review to address the research objective. A total of 90 articles on the subject are identified majorly from Scopus. The analysis of this literature reveals four significant themes underscoring the role people analytics can play in enabling HR as a field and function. These include the following: (a) application of people analytics leads to greater vertical, horizontal and external alignment of the HR function; (b) people analytics facilitates better integration of HR management with the organisation’s strategic planning process; (c) people analytics aids the demonstration of causal links between HR management and business performance; and finally (d) people analytics endows the field with scientific rigour, consistency and resulting credibility. The study contributes to the existing knowledge on people analytics and HR strategy linkage by building a foundation and offering specific propositions for empirical enquiry relating the two. The significance of the study also emanates from its focus on the efficacy of people analytics which is being viewed as an HR approach with immense potential. © The Author(s) 2022.","e-HRM; general HRM; HR metrics/analytics; HR strategy/HR roles; HR technology",""

Design/methodology/approach: An iterative “scoping review” method was used to capture and synthesize relevant academic and grey literature. This is suited to emerging areas of innovation where formal research lags behind evidence from professional or technical sources. Findings: Although the grey literature contains a growing stream of publications aimed at helping PA practitioners to “be ethical,” overall, research on ethical issues in PA is still at an early stage. Optimistic and technocentric perspectives dominate the PA discourse, although key themes seen in the wider literature on digital/data ethics are also evident. Risks and recommendations for PA projects concerned transparency and diverse stakeholder inclusion, respecting privacy rights, fair and proportionate use of data, fostering a systemic culture of ethical practice, delivering benefits for employees, including ethical outcomes in business models, ensuring legal compliance and using ethical charters. Research limitations/implications: This research adds to current debates over the future of work and employment in a digitized, algorithm-driven society. Practical implications: The research provides an accessible summary of the risks, opportunities, trade-offs and regulatory issues for PA, as well as a framework for integrating ethical strategies and practices. Originality/value: By using a scoping methodology to surface and analyze diverse literatures, this study fills a gap in existing knowledge on ethical aspects of PA. The findings can inform future academic research, organizations using or considering PA products, professional associations developing relevant guidelines and policymakers adapting regulations. It is also timely, given the increase in digital monitoring of employees working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. © 2021, Aizhan Tursunbayeva, Claudia Pagliari, Stefano Di Lauro and Gilda Antonelli.","Ethics; HR analytics; HRIS; Human resource information systems; Human resource management; People analytics; Workforce analytics",""

People analytics is becoming ever more extensive and invasive - from cameras checking if workers are at their desk to wearables reporting on worker wellness. We know little, however, on how such technologies of control are supporting management in making well informed decisions about their workers. Drawing from insights from a 16 month ethnographic study, we address this shortcoming through exploring how biometric data is being used to manage people in an elite sports organisation. Our study sheds light on a new form of control enacted through the use of biometric data - a shared control of the body - which calls for a closer relationship between managers and workers as they together attempt to control the body as the main subject of work performance. In particular, we follow the ways in which managers and workers negotiate towards a shared control of the body. Encompassing our findings as part of a theoretical model, we highlight how our findings have implications for theory on organisation control and resistance as well as for people analytics. © 2023, Academy of Management.

There are several forms of Artificial Intelligence bias that promote gender biases. Machine learning models and training data sets are influenced by human developers’ cognitive biases. An algorithm gets hardcoded by such biases and incomplete data produces gender biases as well. If any information retrieved from a dataset is omitted by a cognitive bias, it brings biases. Thus, it is very important to ensure that the Artificial Intelligence data set should represent the complete population, and built-in biases must be overcome. In the present scenario, people’s behavior and opinions are very much influenced by Artificial Intelligence knowingly and unknowingly. In the design pattern of technologies, gender inequality has crept in due to the over-representation of men in the system. The present chapter focuses on the role of Artificial Intelligence and biased algorithms in the models of the Artificial Intelligence-based decision-making process.

Predictive people analytics helps in forecasting future for effective decision-making, whereas prescriptive people analytics provides intelligent recommendations for the minimal next steps to obtain desired results. This chapter is an earnest attempt in exploring the people analytics and its journey from predictive analytics to prescriptive analytics. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Analytics; Descriptive analytics; People analytics; Predictive analytics; Prescriptive analytics","Behavioral research; Decision making; Personnel; 'current; Analytic; Business scenario; Decisions makings; Descriptive analytic; Employee turnover; Measuring performance; People analytic; Prescriptive analytic; Task automation; Predictive analytics"

By examining the role of organizational and environmental contexts, this study contributes to the existing literature by proposing a novel and detailed technology-organization-environment (TOE) model for the complex interplay between firm characteristics and the adoption of data analytics. The results offer valuable insights and practical implications for organizations seeking to leverage data analytics for effective performance management. Design/methodology/approach: The research draws upon a data set encompassing over 21,869 companies operating across all European Union member states. A multilevel logistic regression model was developed to evaluate the influence of organizational and environmental factors on the likelihood of adopting performance analytics in organizations. Findings: The findings indicate that the lack of awareness of the benefits of data analytics and its practical application to address specific business challenges is a significant barrier to its adoption. Organizational contexts, such as variable-pay systems, employee training, hierarchical structures and frequency of monetary rewards, also influence the adoption of data analytics. Research limitations/implications: The study informs managers about the strategic role of data analytics capabilities in performance management for improved business intelligence and driving data culture. Practical implications: The study helps managers understand the strategic role of data analytics capabilities in performance management, leading to improved business intelligence and fostering a data-driven culture in five key areas: structural alignment, strategic decision-making, resource allocation, performance improvement and change management. Originality/value: The study advances the TOE theory, making it a more detailed and complete framework, particularly applicable to the adoption of performance analytics. It identifies the main factors of adoption that play a crucial role in this process. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Analytics; People analytics; Performance analytics; Performance management; TOE framework","Behavioral research; Data Analytics; Economics; Environmental technology; Hierarchical systems; Information management; Personnel training; Regression analysis; Analytic; Data analytics; Organizational context; People analytic; Performance; Performance analytic; Performance management; Strategic role; Technology  organization environments; Technology-organization-environment frameworks; Decision making"

As employees perform their daily activities, they generate vast digital data. These data, when combined with established methods and new analytic techniques, create unprecedented opportunities for studying human behavior at work and have fueled the rise of people analytics as a new institutional field of practice. In this chapter, I describe the emerging field of people analytics and new organizational phenomena that accompany the use of data and algorithms. These practices are affecting how individuals, groups, and organizations function, ranging from decision-making processes and work procedures, to communication and collaboration, to attempts to monitor and control employees. In each of these domains, I describe recent research and propose new research directions. Many of these domains intersect with the emerging field of Computational Social Science, in which disciplinary scholars are applying computational methods to an expanding array of digitized data, pursuing interests that extend far into the organizational domain.

To address this gap, we use closed vocabulary text mining on mock video interviews to train and test machine learning algorithms for predicting interviewee's self-reported (automatic personality recognition) and interviewer-rated personality traits (automatic personality perception). We use 10-fold cross-validation to test the algorithms' accuracy for predicting Big Five personality traits across both rating sources.

Organizations worldwide are increasingly applying people analytics, which enables making more rational, objective and effective decisions about people based on the analysis of data. People analytics has a huge potential while dealing with unpredictable challenges organizations and their employees are facing today. On the one hand, people analytics can reveal the efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of the HRM function, especially emphasizing the strategic partnership role of human resource (HR) professionals. On the other hand, people analytics changes the way organizations identify, manage, develop and control their workforce. The term “people analytics” refers to a novel, evidence-based and data-driven approach to manage workforce. The focus is very much placed on workforce planning, recruitment and selection, development and training, and employee performance while analyzing data to establish causal relationships or other insights and accordingly drive actions by influencing the key decisions. However, applying people analytics involves numerous challenges revealing that not all organizations are on the same maturity level. Although previous research provides some theoretical insights regarding the implications of people analytics in HRM, empirical studies dealing with organizational examples and readiness to create business value through people analytics are nonetheless lacking. The chapter aims to reveal how people analytics is applied in the HRM field. While doing this, a qualitative research was conducted including 12 interviews with HR professionals from different organizations operating in various industries. The results revealed that organizations mainly used only descriptive analytics and the focus was more on HR metrics. In most cases, the decisions about workforce planning or employee remuneration were data-based. However, analytics was less used in employee selection and recruitment, and training and development areas. Not rare were the cases, when intuition of HR professionals or line managers drove the decisions. This chapter has strong practical implications seeing that the results can encourage organizations to rely more on people analytics to optimize the HRM function and add value to organizational success and employee well-being. In addition, the results draw attention to the potential challenges of people analytics organizations should take into considerations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Data; Data-driven decision-making; Evidence-based approach; Human resource management; People analytics; Technological advances",""

For several reasons, Career Management is one of the HRM categories less structured and cared for by organizations. However, having information for the proper management of employees' careers is relevant and considered of high importance, given the impact it has on the development and retention of employees. The employees’ development includes increased knowledge, skills and abilities by each individual, which boosts the progression of his career. Managing knowledge from a perspective that accommodates career management seems to be structural for both organizations and their employees. Based on this premise, this article reviews the literature articulating five concepts: two from the knowledge theoretical field, such as Knowledge Management and Organizational Memory, and three from the HRM field, facing the topics of Talent Management, Career Management and People Analytics. The five concepts are explored, as are the relationships between them. The aim of this article translates into the interrelational description of the five concepts, to understand their common aspects and, thus, expand the approaches to Career Management. The concepts were linked in pairs, due to the absence of literature that addresses the five concepts simultaneously. The theoretical analysis allowed the construction of a conceptual model, which enables understanding of the conceptual convergences and divergences in the organizational and personal ecosystem, supported by local and global knowledge. The model presented will be useful to guide organizations in creating broad Knowledge Management systems, focusing on the people, thus enhancing their management and development. At the same time, it will also be useful for all employees since the model presented aims to contribute to the capitalization of their potential and personal achievement capacity within the organization. Future research may empirically validate the pertinence and applicability of this conceptual model. © 2022 Academic Conferences Limited.

Technically, due to the nonlinear growth of overall turnover rate within a short time, turnover is difficult to accurately predict. As a result, predicting and managing turnover contagion have become key issues in people analytics systems. However, existing studies on turnover contagion has primarily focused on its consequence such as time-lagged turnover, while how to identify turnover contagion effect and leverage it to improve the interpretability of turnover prediction algorithm remains under explored. Building upon the behavioral contagion theory, this research-in-progress paper proposes using machine learning method to calculate the turnover contagion effect based on the susceptible-infective epidemic model.

The authors analyze 99,451 sales pitches on a livestream retailing platform and match them with actual sales transactions. Results reveal that each emotional display, including happiness, uniformly exhibits a negative U-shaped effect on sales over time. The maximum sales resistance appears in the middle rather than at the beginning or end of sales pitches. Taken together, the results show that in one-to-many screen-mediated communications, salespeople should sell with a straight face. In addition, the authors derive closed-form formulae for the optimal allocation of the presence of a face and emotional displays over the presentation span. In contrast to the U-shaped effects, the optimal face presence wanes at the start, gradually builds to a crescendo, and eventually ebbs. Finally, the study shows how to objectively rank salespeople and circumvent biases in performance appraisals, thereby making novel contributions to people analytics.

Yet, culture change is hard. Today, in the hybrid world, most employees still spend the majority of their time working within small work teams, but team members are often remote from one another. These employee interactions are essential to sharing and modeling the norms and behaviors necessary to cultivate the desired culture. Combining behavioral data with the use of organizational network analysis helps to overcome these limitations and provides a deeper understanding of the employee cultural experience—even in the hybrid context. In our research, we evaluated 10 attributes critical to an organization's culture from more than 50,000 employees across three years. Using passive data, we also re-constructed the employee network based on primary interactions. Our research highlighted three critical cultural patterns that will help to more deeply evaluate culture in a hybrid context, but even more importantly,help target local solutions that can be quickly implemented. We call these the three“C's” of cultivating culture. We show that organizational culture clusters in the employee network, is contagious among employees, and is contextually dependent.We discuss our key insights on the three C's, concluding with practical applications for leaders applying these insights in their organization. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Culture; Future of work; Hybrid work; Iopsych; Network analysis; People analytics",""

Linking the concepts of algorithmic governmentality and space of ethics, we analyze how such technologies come to form part of governing practices in specific contexts. We conclude that datafication and automation have huge implications for human reflexivity and the capacity to enact responsibility in decision making. But that itself does not mean that the space for ethical conduct disappears, which is the impression left in some literatures, but rather that is modified and (re) constituted in the interplay of mechanisms of closure (like automating decision making, black boxing and circumventing reflexivity), and opening (such as disclosing contingent values and interests in processes of problematization, contestation and resistance). We suggest that future research investigates in more detail the dynamics of closure and opening in empirical studies of the use and effects of algorithmically driven digital technologies in organizations and societies. © The Author(s) 2022.","algorithmic governmentality; drones; ethics; facial recognition; People Analytics","algorithm; article; automation; boxing; decision making; digital technology; empiricism; ethics; facial recognition; human; organization; responsibility"

Our research focuses on the relationship between digitally tracked work behaviors and employee attitudes and, in so doing, it explores work datafication as a source of data-driven HRM policies and practices. As a chapter of a wider research program, this paper presents some data analysis we performed on a collection of enterprise collaboration software (ECS) data, in search for promising correlations between behavioral and relational (digital) work patterns and employee attitudes. To this end, the digital actions performed by 106 employees in one year are transformed into a graph representation in order to analyze data under two different points of view: the individual (behavioral) perspective, according to the user who performed the action and the performed action, and the social (relational) perspective, making explicit the interactions between users and the objects of their actions. Different employees’ rankings are thus derived and correlated with their attitudes.

This book covers the changing role of HR in the transformation of workplaces to be successful globally. With challenges come new opportunities for HR to completely transform. Currently, technology is considered to be an extension of human beings rather than an external component, which makes people less socially connected. Physical, psychological, and financial well-being in this machine-led world is driving the agenda of HR. Individuals with complex business requirements and long-term goals must coexist with the gig economy, flexible workplaces, and changing priorities. This book precisely addresses these issues. More innovations are needed to create solutions for an ever-growing digital world. This book, therefore, explains how the role of HR executives must be to understand how emerging technologies are affecting company culture, strategy, operational plans, and the hiring of future talent. Crafting a career path for knowledge workers with challenging roles with fulfilling job aspects remains a puzzle. Keeping people engaged and happier is one of the major challenges that HR professionals experience. Different generations in the workplace with differing styles of learning, communication, and dynamic expectations add to these challenges. HR functions must keep evolving to overcome these challenges to transform the workplace, and it is essential to recognize how HR can act as a strategic business advisor through the effective use of technology. This book provides practical advice in these areas. In addition, this book helps professionals, researchers, and practitioners understand the way advanced technology and automation are influencing HR practices and processes in the new normal. The topics are designed to capture the most advanced technology-based HR practices for workplace transformations in industry and academia. This book assembles contributions from experts in HR planning, human capital management, business analytics, people analytics, predictive analysis, and automation from across the world, contributing their knowledge to identify the different attributes of the above-mentioned field of study. The book’s chapters are designed and organized pragmatically to enhance the reader’s experience and interest, reflecting upon a few untouched segments in the HR domain such as HR data privacy, data security, diversity, and inclusion using explainable AI (XAI), blockchain, and metaverse. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Anamika Pandey, Simon Grima, Suruchi Pandey & Balamurugan Balusamy.","",""

These face-to-face interactions have limited technology interfaces and do not meet the evolving demands of the present-day learner to upskill fast, improve employee engagements, and create efficiencies in Learning & Development. With PDO re-shapes its strategy to accelerate and evolve to energy efficiency, renewables, and decarbonisation, it is essential that employees also have the necessary skills to succeed. Therefore, PDO's Learning & Development (L&D) Academy had to re-shape its strategy on how it embraces innovations and technologies to serve modern learners best. Boost side-lined skills, so digital technology becomes part of the workforce's everyday working & learning lives. PDO's L&D provides a unique learning experience for each learner to cater for changes to the learning preferences of the modern learner, who not only want the latest learning programs to take place anywhere but also requires more personalised opportunities for engaging with their peers. PDO's L&D Academy has adopted a bifocal approach to create and sustain an innovative learning technology culture. The first part is the integration of PDO's Learning Management Systems (LMS) with other HR modules such as performance, and people analytics, which will provide PDO's employees with an integrated talent system. The second part is the transformation of PDO's Learning Technology Ecosystem, and this involves creating a pool of learning modalities leveraging technology to deliver immersive, contextual, and personalised learnings. PDO's L&D Academy has set up a Creative Multimedia Lab (CML) to introduce the various learning modes. The CML brings awareness to the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) to a broader population in PDO. It also provides the opportunity to demonstrate how can utilise these technologies to customise and enhance learning and the learner's experience. Developing these customised learnings will bring a superior experience to the learners and hence implant lifelong learning in the flow of work cultures in PDO in the long run.

We do this by focusing on the Italian context. Design/methodology/approach: We conduct a scoping review of data collected between 2018 and 2022 via Google Alerts (GA), a content change detection and notification service that is gaining popularity in scholarly research. Findings: Our findings suggest that the diffusion of PA applications in Italy, especially those of a descriptive nature, is growing. Most of the existing PA applications are positioned in a positive technocratic light, envisioning the value of PA for both employees and organizations. The value for the latter appears to be direct, while the value for employees is realized through organizational initiatives. The findings also suggest that while enablers can vary between PA application types, the barriers, especially technological and environmental, are generic for both descriptive and predictive/prescriptive PA applications. Originality/value: Theoretically, we propose a framework for analyzing PA applications, their values, enablers and barriers. Methodologically, we present and describe in detail a novel approach, drawing on GA that can be used to study PA in specific contexts. Practically, our study serves as a helpful point of reference for managers planning or implementing PA in Italy, for benchmarking PA in Italy over time and for comparative international studies. © 2024, Stefano Di Lauro, Aizhan Tursunbayeva, Gilda Antonelli and Luigi Moschera.","Google alerts; HR Analytics; Human resource management (HRM); People analytics; Qualitative",""

This increases the relevance of people analytics (PA), which are tools for the behavioral analysis of employees. Despite this potential, the successful usage of PA is hindered by employee concerns. Especially in Europe, where the GDPR or equivalent laws apply, employee consent is required before data can be processed in PA. Therefore, PA can only provide relevant insights if employees are willing to share their data. One potential way of achieving this is the use of appeal strategies. In the design of PA, the core strategy that can be used is the inclusion of data owner benefits, such as automated feedback, that are given to employees in exchange for sharing their own data. In this paper, we examine benefits as an appeal strategy and develop four design principles for the inclusion of benefits in PA. Then, we describe an exemplary set of analyses and benefits, demonstrating how our principles may be put into practice. Based on this exemplary implementation, we describe and discuss the results of a user study (n = 46) among employees in the EU and UK. Our study investigates the factors that foster or hinder employees' consent to sharing their data with PA. Then, we introduce our data owner benefits and analyze whether they can positively influence this consent decision. Our introduced data owner benefits were, contrary to our expectations, not suited to motivate our participants to consent to sharing their data. We therefore analyze how participants judge the benefits. Participants generally appreciate having them, confirming the value of including data owner benefits when designing PA. Some of our introduced benefits negatively influenced participants' sharing decision, though, meaning that careful consideration of potential risks is required when conceptualizing them.  © 2023 ACM.","disclosure decision; hr analytics; privacy calculus; qualitative study; talent analytics","Behavioral research; Automated feedback; Behavioral analysis; Core strategy; Design Principles; Disclosure decision; Hr analytic; Privacy calculus; Qualitative study; Talent analytic; User study; Personnel"

Our analysis explains this dissonance through two prevalent identity performance scripts: ‘customerization’ and ‘action-orientation’. Taken together these scripts were identified as having a restrictive impact on the production of more scientifically rigorous PA work. Further, both of these scripts were found to be imbued with cynicism, whereby PA practitioners distance themselves from the commercial presentation of their work outputs.

While concerns over surveillance and issues associated with privacy and discrimination have been raised, the metaverse has the potential to offer opportunities associated with fairer assessment of employee performance and enhancement of the employee experience, especially with respect to gender and race, inclusiveness and workplace equity. This paper aims at shedding light on the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) opportunities and challenges of implementing the metaverse in the workplace, and the role played by AI. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on our past research on AI and the metaverse and provides insights addressed to human resources (HR) scholars and practitioners. Findings: Our analysis of AI applications to the metaverse in the workplace sheds light on the ambivalent role of and potential trade-offs that may arise with this emerging technology. If used responsibly, the metaverse can enable positive changes concerning the future of work, which can promote DEI. Yet, the same technology can lead to negative DEI outcomes if implementations occur quickly, unsupervised and with a sole focus on efficiencies and productivity (i.e. collecting metrics, models etc.). Practical implications: Managers and HR leaders should try to be first movers rather than followers when deciding if (or, better, when) to implement metaverse capabilities in their organizations. But how the metaverse is implemented will be strategic. This involves choices concerning the degree of invasive/pervasive monitoring (internal) as well as make or buy decisions concerning outsourcing AI capabilities. Originality/value: Our paper is one among few (to date) that discusses AI capabilities in the metaverse at the intersection of the HR and information systems(IS) literature and that specifically tackles DEI issues. Also, we take a “balanced” approach when evaluating the metaverse from a DEI perspective. While most studies either demonize or celebrate these technologies from an ethical and DEI standpoint, we aim to highlight challenges and opportunities, with the goal to guide scholars and practitioners towards a responsible use of the metaverse in organizations. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AI; DEI; Employee performance; Global talent management; Immersive technology; Metaverse; Workplace",""

Workforce analytics encompasses a series of interventions used to describe, diagnose, predict, and prescribe the core HR management (HRM) in an organization. Organizations need to engage in advanced data analysis to provide actionable insights to the HR teams in organizations. “AI” is gradually becoming a novel hotspot technology everywhere. The use of big data to provide information and pieces of evidence regarding the operation of the complete system is a key strategic component of HR metrics and workforce analysis. This chapter aids to provide a better understanding of how to strengthen HRM using AI technology. Workforce analytics is a strategic imperative; the chapter explores and discusses the potential of an AI-powered workforce analytics framework in organizations. Workforce analytics is a unified system of engaging organizations’ workforce to enable increased productivity and superior workforce experience. However, workforce management, workplace dynamics, and organizational changes face challenges while implementing technology. Next, the chapter also deals with how organizations are purpose-driven, resilient, and adaptable to dynamic environments toward the organization’s growth. By breaking the myths and biases in AI-based workforce analytics, this chapter pioneers in providing insights about transformational strategies for AI-based workforce management. This chapter discusses the complex relationship between AI, workforce analytics, and its challenges. The study extends to understanding the potential of AI-based workforce analytics and its way forward in HRM. Briefly, this chapter offers a framework that integrates the potential application of AI in workforce analytics in HRM, obstacles while developing an AI-based workforce analytics platform and breaking the myths and biases in workforce analytics. The chapter also covers the organizational policies for AI-based workforce analytics; finally, it contributes to how AI is transforming HR: the future of people analytics and conclusion. The recommendations of this chapter can be used in developing a robust techno-based workforce analytics structure for efficient people management. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Vikas Garg, Richa Goel, Pooja Tiwari, and Esra S.

Yet, they lack oversight over the systems that process their data. That means that potential analysis errors or hidden biases are hard to uncover. Recent data protection legislation tries to tackle these issues, but it is inadequate. It does not prevent data misusage while at the same time stifling sensible use cases for data. We think the conflict between data protection and increasingly data-driven systems should be solved differently. When access to an employees' data is given, all usages should be made transparent to them, according to the concept of inverse transparency. This allows individuals to benefit from sensible data usage while addressing the potentially harmful consequences of data misusage. To accomplish this, we propose a new design approach for workforce analytics software we refer to as inverse transparency by design. To understand the developer and user perspectives on the proposal, we conduct two exploratory studies with students. First, we let small teams of developers implement analytics tools with inverse transparency by design to uncover how they judge the approach and how it materializes in their developed tools. We find that architectural changes are made without inhibiting core functionality. The developers consider our approach valuable and technically feasible. Second, we conduct a user study over three months to let participants experience the provided inverse transparency and reflect on their experience. The study models a software development workplace where most work processes are already digital. Participants perceive the transparency as beneficial and feel empowered by it. They unanimously agree that it would be an improvement for the workplace. We conclude that inverse transparency by design is a promising approach to realize accepted and responsible people analytics.  © 2023 ACM.","data sovereignty; HR analytics; privacy by design; qualitative study","Personnel; Software design; Data driven; Data sovereignty; Data usage; Design approaches; Digital environment; Driven system; HR analytic; Potential analysis; Qualitative study; Users perspective; Transparency"

In building an effective People Analytics, the need for data governance becomes important as data is the main source of information for analysis. The intense use of data becomes a challenge for companies, especially in terms of governance. The DAMA-DMBOK 2 data governance framework model which focuses on 10 data management functions was chosen as it can be adapted to HC context. Each of the management functions within the framework were adopted into several focuses on data management in the context of HC. In applying the concept of data governance, a hierarchy model for data governance operations was chosen as it serves as a guideline for cascading process that covers from the top level into the most basic level of data governance practices. HC data governance was applied using the modified DAMA-DMBOK 2 and can be felt into several levels. However, the limitation of using DAMA-DMBOK 2 framework is that it only focuses on data management focusing on HC, and the framework proposed in this paper is designed for large established companies. © 2022 ACM.","DAMA-DMBOK 2; Human Capital; People Analytics","Behavioral research; Data Analytics; Decision making; Personnel; Capital management; DAMA-DMBOK 2; Data governances; Decisions makings; Human capitals; Human resources management; Management functions; Management operation; People analytic; Technological development; Information management"

Work environments have also been impacted by the phenomenon, which has completely transformed the way employees interact with each other, the information they use to perform their jobs, their attitudes toward their careers, and their expectations towards their employers. Many of these changes are due to new technological advances and to the increasing availability of HR data, and this trend is likely to increase further in the future. In fact, with the advancement of digitization, new sources of structured and unstructured data are becoming accessible to HR practitioners, enabling them to analyze the complexity of HR decision making more deeply. Organizations have at their disposal a wealth of information related to their workforce and organizational performance, as well as various external sources that, when combined, can be treated as big data that can offer useful information for business-driven decision-making, if approached with the appropriate analytical tools. HR departments are thus facing a period of transformation in order to take advantage of the opportunities arising from the aforementioned innovations, as well as to deal with increasingly numerous and complex challenges. HR department members must not miss the important opportunity for professional growth offered by digital transformation. Despite the obvious difficulty in adapting to this relatively recent phenomenon, which to be fully exploited requires skills that until now were not required to them, HRs will have to work hard to claim the legitimacy of conducting operations with a new data-driven approach, developing the necessary skills. This should therefore not be seen as a complication of their duties, but as the long-awaited opportunity to finally consolidate the strategic importance of the function. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Digital transformation; HR analytics; HR department; HR management; People analytics",""

Using machine learning models in this field might be beneficial but requires some unique considerations in how organizations govern, assure, audit, and support the use of AI. While substantial work has been done on AI ethics, organizational implantation studies are rare and often anecdotal, particularly in HR. In this article, we would like to better understand the common ethical considerations and organizational responses for developing AI for HR use and how different organizations engage with them by comparing two case studies. This paper begins by reviewing AI ethical issues specific to HR and describes the common mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. After this introduction, case studies are illustrated, and the organizational responses in both cases are analyzed. The discussion section shows that although the organizations were aware of the AI ethics issues, their responses varied and depended on different governance and self-regulation mechanisms that might have impinged their ability to proactively engage with ethical issues. A second finding is that the organization used only a relatively small set of mitigation strategies proposed in the literature, and we propose several reasons for this. These insights might be important to various organizations deploying or developing AI for HR use that want better governance, assurance, and audit mechanisms to responsibly address the ethical issues raised by AI in this field. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","AI ethics; Ethical deliberation; HR analytics; People analytics","AI ethic; Case-studies; Embeddings; Ethical deliberation; Ethical issues; HR analytic; Mitigation strategy; Organisational; People analytic; Technological advances; analytical framework; artificial intelligence; ethics; human resource; machine learning; Ethical technology"

A person leaves traces of his behavior in what he produces, such as videos and texts. Some studies point to the possibility of identifying a behavioral profile from a textual production. In this work, we seek to identify the archetype of individuals within the business environment based on their curriculum texts. We combine the behavioral profile assessment (BPA) archetypes (Planner, Analyst, Communicator, and Executor) with 26, 636 curriculum to apply machine learning models. For this task, we used classification and regression approaches. The main algorithm used for the approaches was the SVM. The results suggest that the archetypes are better modeled using regression techniques, obtaining an MSE of 4.49 in the best case.

This debate cannot only be explained by diverging norms and values, for example, practitioners realizing commercial opportunities while being criticized by academic commentaries. Instead, an alternative explanation suggests that the opposing views can be reconciled by diving into the conceptual differences regarding what analytical methods and data sources people analytics entails. Hence, this paper proposes the conceptions of operational and strategic people analytics based on a literature review of academics’ and practitioners’ literature. Four propositions about these conceptions’ privacy and performance implications are derived. Future research should empirically validate these propositions. © BLED 2022.

Yet, research reports that not all businesses ensure the optimum functioning of their people. This is evident from reports on (a) low levels of employee engagement, (b) deployed positions do not utilise peoples' 'competence', (c) leadership lacks information linking employees to strategy execution and resultant business performance, (d) measuring employees' contribution to business performance more readily at the tactical and operational levels than the strategic level of measurement, and (e) failure of strategy execution. Neglecting people is an enigma as leadership has long honed tools to make the most of their employees. One such tool is people analytics and another is strategy shaping. Consequently, we explored businesses use of people analytics in strategy execution, the vehicle ensuring business performance. This paper reports on the study. A literature review integrated strategy and people analytics culminating in a diagnostic which leadership can use to unlock human competence. An empirical study followed. Limited empirical evidence on the topic justified an exploratory survey which utilised an online questionnaire to collect vast amounts of standardised data from a purposively selected sample as best fit, which is uncommon. The data were descriptively analysed. The findings (a) showed that strategic level measurement is present at all levels of strategy shaping, and (b) overlooked at the business operational level where strategy is translated and executed, (c) revealed that these overlooked measurements are consequential for unlocking human competence, and (d) illustrated how people link to strategy execution. These findings provide preliminary evidence necessitating further descriptive and explanatory studies. This diagnostic provides requisite information enabling leadership to optimise the functioning of their employees by deploying suitably competent people in appropriate positions, rendering them available to perform, resulting in higher engagement levels, enhancing effective strategy execution, and improving business performance. This study contributes knowledge by demonstrating how people link to strategy execution, enabling leadership to make better decisions by discerning and selecting the critical people measures ensuring strategy execution and thus, business performance. © 2022 Authors.

Success is driven here through data-driven methodologies. The primary objective of this research is to identify, rank and interrelate challenges affecting the adoption of people analytics in India. The interpretative structural modelling (ISM) approach is applied to rank and interrelate these challenges in the Indian context. MICMAC analysis is conducted to reveal the driving power and dependence of these challenges of people analytics. The MICMAC analysis also indicates the relative importance and interdependence between these challenges in the Indian context. During the first phase of the research, 12 challenges are identified from the literature, and these people analytics challenges are validated based on expert opinions. During the second phase, ISM identifies ‘Leveraging existing enterprise resources’ as the most important challenge in the Indian context among the 11 validated challenges. MICMAC analysis identifies all 11 challenges as ‘linkage challenges’ with high dependence and driving power. For researchers, this methodology facilitates further carrying out exploratory studies and focusing their interactions through hierarchical structures.

HRA is a process that uses statistical techniques, to link HR practices to organizational performance. The purpose of this study is to carry out recent development in HRA, bibliometric analysis and content analysis to present a comprehensive account of HRA to fill the gap in the evolution and status of its research. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on the recent advances in HRA in terms of it evolution and advancement by analyzing and drawing conclusions 480 articles retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database from 2003 to March 2022. The methodology is divided into four steps: data collection, analysis, visualization and interpretation. The study performed a rigorous bibliometric assessment of HRA using the bibliometric R-package and VOS viewer. Findings: The findings based on the literature survey, and bibliometric analysis, reveal the path-breaking articles, the prominent authors, most contributing institutions and countries that have contributed to the HRA scholarship. The results show that the number of publications has significantly increased from 2015 onwards, reaching a maximum of 101 journals in 2021. The USA, China, India, Canada and the United Kingdom were the most productive countries in terms of the total number of publications. Human Resource Management Journal, Human Resource Management, International Journal of Manpower, and Journal of Organizational Effectiveness-People and Performance are the top four academic outlets in the field of HRA. Additionally, the study identifies four clusters of HRA research and the knowledge gaps in HRA scholarship. Research limitations/implications: The present study is based on the articles retrieved from the WoS. The study underpins HRA research to understand the trends and presents a structured account. However, the study is not free from limitations. It is recommended that future research could be undertaken by combining WoS and Scopus databases to have a more detailed and comprehensive view. This study indicates that the field is still in its infancy stage. Hence, there is a need for more arduous research on the topic to help develop a better understanding of this field. Originality/value: The findings of knowledge clusters will drive future researchers to augment the field. The evolution of the four clusters and their subsequent development will fill the gaps in the literature. This study enriches the HRA literature and the findings of this study may assist academicians, researchers and managers in furthering their research in the identified research clusters. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","HR decisions; HRA; Organizational performance; People analytics; Talent analytics",""

This type of software has seen a surge of interest since the start of the pandemic, as managers attempt to retain oversight of workers in remote or distributed conditions. However, “bossware” is not monolithic but highly differentiated, with each product created by specific companies, with specific affordances, for specific purposes. This article thus builds a more articulated portrait of bossware by mapping the landscape. It first defines a schema based on the “expansiveness” and “invasiveness” of this software and maps key products along these two axes. It then develops a bossware typology ranging from spyware through to soft-bossware and productivity-ware, highlighting their differences in terms of data captured, userbases, perceived legitimacy, and existing safeguards. The article concludes by offering several approaches to investigating these technical regimes and stressing bossware as a site of both power and counterpower. © The author(s), 2024.","bossware; employee monitoring; future of work; people analytics; productivity surveillance",""

Diversity and inclusion (D&I) is a topic of increasing relevance across virtually all sectors of our society, with the potential for a significant impact on corporations and more broadly on our economy and society. While people are typically the most valuable asset of every organization, human resources (HR) in general, and D&I in particular, are dominated by qualitative approaches. This paper introduces an agent-based simulation that can quantify the impact of certain aspects of D&I on corporate performance. The simulation provides a parsimonious and compelling explanation of the impact of hiring and promotion biases on the resulting corporate gender balance, accurately replicating real-world data about gender imbalances across multiple industry sectors. In addition, the paper shows that the simulation can be used to predict the likely impact of different D&I interventions. Specifically, once a company has become imbalanced, even removing all promotion biases is not sufficient to rectify the situation, and it can take decades to undo the imbalances initially created by these biases. These and other results demonstrate that agent-based simulation is a powerful approach for managing D&I in corporate settings and could become an invaluable tool for the strategic and tactical management of human resources. © 2023 by the authors.","agent-based modeling; agent-based simulation; applied complexity science; corporate management; diversity and inclusion; gender; people analytics",""

The introduction of the severe quarantine limitations related to the pandemic of COVID-19 and the avalanche-type character of the digitalization of society activated the changes in the sphere of social-labor relations, where the interests of different groups of workers are asymmetric. Many researchers who studied these phenomena mark the presence of divergences in individual advantages concerning the different formats of a labor organization of employers and hired workers. The dynamic of changes predefines the necessity of further research, which is why this subject acquires greater relevance. Our research aims to substantiate the approaches to balancing the interests of different categories of workers regarding the labor organization formats by exposing disbalances in the conditions of full-scale war in Ukraine. For monitoring, diagnosis, and management of disbalances, we substantiate the use of Data Mining in People Analytics (PA), the necessity of their combination with the classic instruments of study of personnel behavior, the use of active (reactive) formats of study of persons’ opinions in the extreme terms of running a business. The research results correlate with and confirm the world's tendencies of introducing a hybrid model of labor organization. The novelty of the executed research consists of substantiating the approaches to balancing the interests of the employees regarding different labor organization formats in the conditions of full-scale war in Ukraine. The presented study expands the scope of knowledge in the field of PA, as it takes into account new circumstances that have not existed since the end of World War II. It supplements data on work organization formats obtained by researchers of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with new data obtained as a result of a survey of employees and managers of various organizations in Ukraine, where there is a full-scale war. The presented study is one of the first that emphasizes the features of PA during wartime and explains why in such conditions it is necessary to combine Data Mining techniques with classic tools for studying personnel behavior.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is designed as a short review of the current thinking in the ethics of PA, a practical journey through the progression of PA across the pandemic and a theoretical exploration of PA through three lenses: virtue ethics, critical social theory and actor network theory. Findings: The authors suggest that PA raises novel ethical issues in terms of personal impact, increased penetration into working and home lives and the punch delivered in terms of organisational and behavioural change. Research limitations/implications: This study provides a short review of three theoretical approaches to PA. Detailed research and reflection is required to develop and extend an ethics of PA. While engagement with the ethics of PA requires gaining an understanding of the discipline, ideas and jargon of HR management, it is essential that ethicists engage with PA as HR departments take on greater influence and adopt executive roles. Practical implications: PA is now at the top of the HR management agenda, but there is limited understanding of the technology, the ethics and the new responsibilities it brings for HR management. This paper raises the profile of an ethical agenda, which practitioners should engage with. Social implications: The ethical consequences of PA have social implications as work practices change and hybrid working becomes prevalent. It has the potential to change the relationship between home and the workplace.

Many companies rely on external software provided by PA vendors to support processes, such as screening of job applications or assessing employee’s performance. Using this software can impose multiple ethical risks. As there is only limited research about how fairness is constructed by PA vendors in practice, the aim of this research is to investigate the construction of fairness by PA vendors and to understand which phases of the employment life cycle are impacted by fairness. To do so, we analysed 21 websites of PA vendors. We identified seven different concepts of fairness. Furthermore, we were able to identify the phases that are most and least impacted by fairness in practice. Thus, our findings reveal that fairness is rather understood as a “thing” than a process or a particular outcome of a decision. This is important to understand, as it makes a difference in how fairness is theoretically constructed and how it is actually constructed in practice, which provides us a more differentiated understanding of fairness in the employment life cycle.

This shift in data use gradually altered the dynamics of the Human Resource Management (HRM) role, and organizations now expect high-quality analysis from HR professionals. Various studies suggested that the use of Human Resource Analytics (HRA) would assist HR professionals in developing diverse viewpoints on their contribution to the financial targets of organizations through the creation of suitable measurements. Still, not many researchers have explored the role of HRA in increasing the business outcomes of Indian organizations. In this study, we analysed the role of HRA competencies in determining business outcomes as well as examined the gap existing in the expected and existing competencies of HR analysts in Indian organizations. Our in-depth literature review prepared a conceptual framework based on Capability Motivation and Opportunity (CMO) model. A quantitative methodology was adopted to gather the data as it integrates the components of HRA competency and measures their impact on business outcomes. A structured questionnaire was designed and distributed to 230 HR professionals, including HRA users as well as HR managers who work in different organizations in the city of Bengaluru. The data were analysed using various statistical tools and SPSS software. Overall, our study provides a significant depiction of the role of HRA in determining business outcomes, as well as the gap between the competencies demonstrated by HR analysts and the competency levels expected of them. © Este es un artículo en acceso abierto","BASP; COM; Competency Model; Decision-making; HR Analytics; HRA; Human Resource Analytics; Human Resource Management; LAMP",""

New cohorts of students, COVID-19 pandemic and pressure in the labour market on the labour force to master the technology-related skills and competence serve as main drivers for universities to redesign the way of teaching. A radical transformation of education caused by technologies is related to several aspects, such as online teaching or using other technologies in both physical and online learning environments with the focus on student-centred learning. The existing literature suggests that educational innovation through technologies allows for the adoption of collaborative, inclusive and student-driven pedagogy. The paper aims at revealing educational innovation through information and communication technologies in one of the courses for master’s students, namely People Analytics. While disclosing the particular case of one course, the paper seeks to provide the argumentation (advantages and disadvantages) for choosing specific tools and how these tools are embedded. The use of tools such as Zoom, digital escape rooms, Mentimeter, and Padlet, is presented.

Accordingly, this study draws on the human capital resource (HCR) and HCR complementarity frameworks to investigate the individual and collective impact of analytical and storytelling skills on People Analysts perceived job performance. A mixed-method sequential explanatory research design is adopted, finding mixed results. Consistent with existing research, results from Phase 1 find People Analysts perceive storytelling skills to be positively associated with their job performance. However, contrary to existing claims, the findings reveal that analytical skills are only perceived to be significant in influencing People Analysts job performance when combined with storytelling skills, supporting a complementarity HCR relationship. To further explain the findings from Phase 1, Phase 2 involved collecting data from 50 people analytics professionals via semi-structured interviews. Results from the thematic analysis reinforce the survey findings while also illustrating that People Analysts perceive the complementarity relationship between analytical and storytelling skills as important for improving job performance. Accordingly, we argue that debate in this area should be reframed to acknowledge the necessity of complementarities in building people analytics capabilities. © 2023 The Authors.

Based on a study of 40 companies, it discusses the implications of HRA for practitioners, praxis and practices in HRM and adds to this a concern with whether HRA is enhancing mutuality in employment relationships. Design/methodology/approach: Using an abductive approach, the authors analyzed data from semistructured interviews with an HRA leader or specialist in 40 large organizations. Findings: While wrestling with the challenge of data quality and integration, the practice of descriptive analytics is widely adopted in these companies and the majority can demonstrate improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of HR activities through predictive analytics. The analytical competence of HR specialists is an ongoing issue. While much more research is needed, the companies in the authors’ sample demonstrated some valuable examples of mutual gains from HRA. Practical implications: Education in HRA must not only help to raise quantitative competencies among HR specialists but should also help them to ask critical questions about the theoretical propositions and subjective data points being built into HRA. Boundary spanning is important to enable effective HRA and processes for employee voice to be improved. Arguably, the time has come for a more formalized data analytics' strategy in large organizations.

Since so far empirical evidence on this is, however, lacking, the authors' study examines which combinations of data and analyses are employed and which combinations deliver on the promise of improved decision quality. Design/methodology/approach: Theoretically, the paper employs a neo-configurational approach for founding and conceptualizing HRA. Methodically, based on a sample of German organizations, two varieties (crisp set and multi-value) of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) are employed to identify combinations of data and analyses sufficient and necessary for HRA success. Findings: The authors' study identifies existing configurations of data and analyses in HRM and uncovers which of these configurations cause improved decision quality. By evidencing that and which combinations of data and analyses conjuncturally cause decision quality, the authors' study provides a first confirmation of HRA success. Research limitations/implications: Major limitations refer to the cross-sectional and national sample and the usage of subjective measures. Major implications are the suitability of neo-configurational approaches for future research on HRA, while deeper conceptualizing and researching both the characteristics and outcomes of HRA constitutes a core future task. Originality/value: The authors' paper employs an innovative theoretical-methodical approach to explain and analyze conditions that conjuncturally cause decision quality therewith offering much needed empirical evidence on HRA success. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; HR analytics; HR decision Support; People analytics",""

Furthermore, HR leaders also have no choice but to accommodate technology based innovative processes in functions like recruitment, benefits management and payroll. In this regard, one interesting area that is grabbing the attention of HR practitioners these days is the so-called “Internet of Things” (IoT). “The Internet of things (IoT) is the internet-based working of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as “connected devices” and “smart devices”), buildings and other items - embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data’. IoT devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc. are connected devices that can help in the management of the HR practices better. With this information can be easily stored, transferred or retrieved about the employees for taking critical decisions. At the same time, ‘smart’ devices which use their sensors to provide real-time information from the physical environment and support data analytics in efficient and fast decision making. Internet of Things that has been adopted by organizations worldwide can help in setting-up the ecosystem for the organization to connect, track and measure the effectiveness and efficiency of humans in the digital work environment. It will also enable employers to make appropriate HR decisions to generate organizational growth with the availability of easy and cost-effective employee data. As the businesses are moving towards a quantified workplace where the decisions are made on data analytics (specifically on people analytics in HRM), IoT Technology help to quantify employee work focusing on productivity, fitness, wellness and improving the work environment. Therefore, the HR professionals need to realize the application of these web-based technological devices and circuits also known as ‘IoT’. It is expected that in future ‘IoT’ is going to transform the human resource management of the digital workplace environment and digital business operations effectively. The chapter would investigate and develop upon the importance and adoption of IoT worldwide in global organizations to build the best practices that are in use. It would focus on future innovations that can be made to HR practices and employee management with the help of connected devices so that people analytics can result in more sustainable organizations. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Connected devices; IoT; People analytics; Sustainable HR operations",""

The prevalence of Online Professional Networks (OPNs), such as LinkedIn, enables the new paradigm for talent recruitment and job search. However, the dynamic and complex nature of such talent information imposes significant challenges to identify prospective talent sources from large-scale professional networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to create a job transition network where vertices stand for organizations and a directed edge represents the talent flow between two organizations for a time period. By analyzing this job transition network, it is able to extract talent circles in a way such that every circle includes the organizations with similar talent exchange patterns. Then, the characteristics of these talent circles can be used for talent recruitment and job search. To this end, we develop a talent circle detection model and design the corresponding learning method by maximizing the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) of inferred probability for the edge existence based on edge weights. Then, the identified circles will be labeled by the representative organizations as well as keywords in job descriptions. Moreover, based on these identified circles, we develop a talent exchange prediction method for talent recommendation. Finally, we have performed extensive experiments on realworld data. The results show that, our method can achieve much higher modularity when comparing to the benchmark approaches, as well as high precision and recall for talent exchange prediction. © 2016 ACM.","People analytics; Talent circle detection","Data mining; Employment; Job analysis; Societies and institutions; Circle detection; Complex nature; Directed edges; High-precision; Job description; Learning methods; People analytics; Prediction methods; Complex networks"

This same technology can make an enormous difference in human resource and talent management enabling individuals to market their skillsets and organizations to describe their job requirements down to a granular level of detail in the hopes that searches, optimization algorithms, and simple recommendation engines can guide them towards an optimal decision for talent management - the right person in the right job at the right time. While these analytic tools are important to optimizing decisions, it is not always evident where to apply them for the best possible effect. The Army advanced analytics in a way that allows them to forecast their ability to fill critical job requirements over time by forecasting new acquisitions, promotions, and losses at the aggregate level. However, that system falls far short of being able to match people to positions in an optimal manner and results in long lag times when it comes to meeting emerging requirements. A new data collection system identifying both unitrequired and individual-possessed knowledge, skills, and behaviors (KSBs) will enable the Army to make forecasts and fill positions much more rapidly (along with assigning the best person to the position) provided the data is available to decision makers at the right time to best support talent management decisions.

Typical problems in HR analytics include the estimation of churn rates, the identification of knowledge and skill in an organization, and the prediction of success on a job. HR analytics, as opposed to the simple use of key performance indicators, is a growing field of interest because of the rapid growth of volume, velocity, and variety of HR data, driven by the digitalization of work processes. Personnel files used to be in steel lockers in the past. They are now stored in company systems, along with data from hiring processes, employee satisfaction surveys, e-mails, and process data. With the growing prevalence of HR analytics, a discussion around its ethics needs to occur. The objective of this paper is to discuss the ethical implications of the application of sophisticated analytical methods to questions in HR management. This paper builds on previous literature in algorithmic fairness that focuses on technical options to identify, measure, and reduce discrimination in data analysis.

Strengthening Human Resource (HR) practices and adopting HR technologies such as Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS), that can collect, store and report workforce data are often described as a potential solution to this problem. Indeed, examples from other industries show that HRIS can help to launch or manage, as well as provide ongoing insights concerning the whole career cycle of an employee. However, few of the existing studies that discuss technology or its impacts on the future of work have focused on health organizations, and those that do have not received sufficient attention in health literature. Furthermore, such contributions as there have been have either prioritized a particular type of technology or focused mainly on the effect of automation on health professionals' work. They have thus overlooked the full range of possible uses of these technologies and, specifically, have neglected the topic of HR for Health (HRH) management in health organizations. The primary aim of this paper is to address this lacuna, with specific reference to the existing categorization of HR technological disruptions. To conclude, health organizations and the health and HR professionals who work within them need to use HRIS responsibly, finding a balance between the drive for innovation, productivity and efficiency and respect for all potential legal, ethical and compliance issues, as well as taking account of the importance of HRH wellbeing and satisfaction. © 2019 The Author(s).","eHealth; Health care management; HRIS; Human resource information systems; Human resources; Information systems; People analytics","Delivery of Health Care; Health Personnel; Health Services Research; Humans; Information Systems; Management Information Systems; Personnel Management; attention; automation; health care management; health care organization; human; information system; productivity; respect; review; satisfaction; telehealth; wellbeing; health care delivery; health care personnel; health services research; information system; organization and management; personnel management; standards; trends"

This study confirms the need for algorithms to be correctly programmed, taking account of these occupational risks. In the same way as supervisors have to be trained in risk prevention to be able to perform their work, the algorithm must be programmed to weigh up the occupational risks – and when such features do not exist, steps must be taken to prevent the algorithm being used to direct workers. The algorithm must assess all (known) factors posing a risk to workers’ health and safety.

A clear understanding of talent flows is critical for many applications, such as human resource planning, brain drain monitoring, and future workforce forecasting. However, existing studies on talent flow analysis are either qualitative or limited by coarse level quantitative modeling. To this end, in this paper, we provide a fine-grained data-driven approach to model the dynamics and evolving nature of talent flows by leveraging the rich information available in job transition networks. Specifically, we first investigate how to enrich the sparse talent flow data by exploiting the correlations between the stock price movement and the talent flows of public companies. Then, we formalize the talent flow modeling problem as to predict the increments of the edge weights in the dynamic job transition network. In this way, the problem is transformed into a multi-step time series forecasting problem. A deep sequence prediction model is developed based on the recurrent neural network model, which consumes multiple input sources derived from dynamic job transition networks. Finally, experimental results on real-world data show that the proposed model outperforms other benchmark models in terms of prediction accuracy. The results also indicate that the proposed model can provide reasonable performance even if the historical talent flow data are not completely available. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","deep sequence prediction model; People analytics; talent flow","Analytical models; Data structures; Deep neural networks; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Industry; Personnel; Predictive analytics; Human resource planning; People Analytics; Predictive models; Quantitative modeling; Recurrent neural network model; Sequence prediction; Stock price movements; Talent Flow; Recurrent neural networks"

In this work, we study a large collection of corporation-wide employee peer reviews from a technology enterprise. Motivated by the challenges we outline in our analysis of employee review data, our work makes two main contributions in the domain of people analytics: (a) Sentiment-Aspect Model (SAM): we introduce a stylized log-linear model that identifies the hidden aspects and sentiment within an employee peer review corpus, (b) Interpretable Sentiment-Aspect Representations (EMPLOYEE2VEC): Using SAM, we produce a vector space embedding for each employee, containing an overall sentiment score per aspect, and (c) Summarization of Employee Peer Reviews (PEERSUM): we summarize an employee's peer reviews with just a few sentences which reflect the most prevalent traits and associated sentiment for the employee as much as possible. We show that our model SAM can use the structure present in the dataset as supervision to discover meaningful latent traits and sentiment embodied in the reviews. Our employee vector representations Employee2vecprovide a compact, interpretable overview of their evaluation.

Similarly, today's data scientists must appreciate the unique aspects of behavioral data and the special circumstances which surround HR data and HR systems. Finally, traditional HR professionals must become familiar with research methods, statistics, and data systems in order to collaborate with these new specialized partners and teams. Despite the increasing importance of this diversity of skill, many organizations are still unprepared to build teams with the comprehensive skills necessary to have high performing HR Analytics functions. And importantly, all these considerations are magnified by the introduction and acceleration of machine learning in HR. This book will serve as an introduction to these areas and provide guidance on building the connectivity across domains required to establish well-rounded skills for individuals and best practices for organizations when beginning to apply advanced analytics to workforce data. It will also introduce machine learning and where it fits within the larger HR Analytics framework by explaining many of its basic tenets and methodologies.

The findings were summarized in the People Analytics Effectiveness Wheel. Findings: The People Analytics Effectiveness Wheel identifies four categories of ingredients that a people analytics team requires to be effective. These are enabling resources, products, stakeholder management and governance structure. Under each category, multiple sub-themes are discussed, such as data and infrastructure; senior management support; and knowledge, skills, abilities and other characteristics (KSAOs) (enablers).

Process Mining as a data-driven process discovery, analysis and monitoring method offers the continuous monitoring of process performance. In practice, however, severe limitations arise when assessing the time effort required for process execution as many enterprise resource planning systems do not record the time required for the execution of activities. In this context, the contributions of this paper are twofold: first, we present Effort Mining as a process- and system-agnostic method that allows us to estimate the time required for process steps; second, we apply this method to compare the effort before and during the lockdown as a means to identify productivity gaps induced by the pandemic. Our investigation has identified no substantial change in the employees' productivity, indicating that the underlying business processes and corresponding technology were fit for purpose in both scenarios.

While most of the creators prefer to keep the content free by allowing ads, these Ad blockers are causing harm. They are useful to block spam ads but without any means of segregation between good or bad, it is prone to block 'Advertisements'. This paper focuses on how the Business analysis could be employed to construct a strategy that companies that display written content like e-newspapers & e-magazines could employ to deal with the threat posed by Advertisement blocking software. The problem statement is explained in four phases of Business Analytics: Operations Analytics studied the models that predict the effect of the Ad-blockers on the organization; Customer Analytics guided the research by predicting the customer behaviour, marketing decisions, and Strategy. Accounting Analytics dealt with how the Ad-blockers affect the company's financial bottom line. Finally, People Analytics suggested the measures that strengthen the company's internal organization to deal with Ad-blockers. The main strategy to tackle this issue was taken from Wharton's Future of Advertising (WFoA) program's R.A.V.E.S.[1] that is an advertisement must be relevant and respectful, actionable, valuable and value generating with exceptional experience and share-worthy story from the end user. Alternative strategies like Enhancing the User Experience in the mobile application, collaborating and sharing knowledge articles with similar companies was also discussed. The anticipated effects of the proposed strategy were measured through various metrics that included customer satisfaction levels through paid apps, subscription fees, pay-per-click thoughts. Key drivers to the customer's chance of viewing the advertisement were discussed along with questions for measurement were answered thereby giving the entire Business Analytics Model implementation. © 2017 IEEE.","Business Analytics; Decision Sciences; Operations Management","Artificial intelligence; Customer satisfaction; Marketing; Sales; Business analytics; Customer behaviour; Decision Sciences; Marketing decision; Mobile applications; Model implementation; Operations management; Problem statement; Big data"

Data mining for erecruitment analysis is important in order to extract a knowledge base for people analytics. Skills and competences are the key variables for people analytics and can be drawn from job advertisements. Leveraging the raw information of online job offers, provides a rich source for people analytics. Detecting the appropriate skills and competences for a job from raw text data and associate them with a job seeker is an increasing challenge. The main objective of this paper is the proposal of a framework aiming to collect online job advertisements from a web source which concerns IT job offers and to extract from the raw text the required skills and competences for specific jobs.

From video cameras to GPS, these technologies allow for constant monitoring of workers' activities; however, recently two new forms of control have emerged. One consisting in giving customers a controlling role over workers' performance and another, the ""big data"" (algorithms and artificial intelligence) which allow employers to process information about their employees in a far more efficient manner and at a much lower cost than has been the case until now. This makes it possible to profile workers automatically and even allows technology itself to replace human resources supervisors and managers and to make decisions that have legal effects on the employees (recruitment, promotion, dismissals, etc.). This entails great risks of discrimination by the technology in command, as well as the defenselessness of the worker, who is unaware of the reasons underlying such a decision and specific health and occupational risks for workers.

With increased and diverse sources of data that are available to organizations today, there is ample opportunity to apply analytics for informed decision making in this field. This paper reveals useful insights that help streamline the Talent Acquisition process in the Indian IT Industry. The paper adopts a data-centric approach to examine the critical determinants for efficient and effective Talent Acquisition process in IT organizations. Selected supervised machine learning algorithms are applied for the analysis of the dataset. The study is likely to help organizations in reassessing their talent acquisition strategy with respect to key parameters like expected cost to company (CTC), candidate sourcing channels and optimal joining period. © 2020, Asia Pacific Journal of Information Systems.

Some of these forms are finding their way into the workplace, understood as augmentations to workplace atmospheres. What has been called the ‘quantified workplace’ requires its workers to log their rates of stress, wellbeing and subjective sense of productivity on a scale of 1–5 or by emoji, in a context in which Human Resources (HR) professionals develop a vocabulary of Workforce Analytics, People Analytics, Human Capital Analytics or Talent Analytics, and all this in the context of managing the work environment or its atmosphere. Atmosphere is mood, a compote of emotions. Emotions are a part of a human package characterized as ‘the quantified self’, a self intertwined with – subject to but also compliant with – tracking and archiving. The logical step for managing atmospheres is to track emotions at a granular and large-scale level. Through the concept of the digital crowd, rated and self-rating, as well as emotion-tracking strategies, the human resource (as worker and consumer) engages in a new politics of the crowd, organized around what political philosopher Jodi Dean calls, affirmatively, ‘secondary visuality’, high-circulation communication fusing speech, writing and image as a new form. This is the visuality of communicative, or social media, capitalism. But to the extent that it is captured by HR, is it an exposure less to crowd-sourced democracy, and more a stage in turning the employee into an on-the-shelf item in a digital economy warehouse, assessed by Likert scales? While HR works on new atmospheres of work, what other atmospheres pervade the context of labour, and can these be deployed in the generation of other types of affect, ones that work towards the free association of labour and life? © The Author(s), 2019.","analytics; atmosphere; caring; emotional labour; labour power; smile detection",""

Findings: Building upon the existing literature, this paper presents an operational HRA framework, positioning HRA as an analytical process through integrating advanced statistical methodology. HRA presents a tool to obtain evidence-based analytical results for improving people-related performance, operational effectiveness, and ultimately the impact of the business strategy. By using HR big data, HRA impacts multiple organizational levels, from individual employees to HR functions and the organizational strategy. Practical implications: While research on data analytics has recently flourished across various management fields, this has not been the case for the broader field of HR. This is especially a growing concern as the lack of understanding of the basics and fundamentals of people analytics in the field of HR may delay the effective implementation and operationalization of HRA and present additional barriers impacting on-going HR activities, as well as HR’s role as a strategic business partner.

Design/methodology/approach: Employing bibliometric information from research databases, the publication, citations, h-index and newly developed individual annualized h-index (hIa-index) for a sample of university faculty is examined (N = 684). Information relating to turnover decisions from a human resource (HR) information system and bibliometric data from a research database are combined to explore research performance differences across cohorts of retained, resigned or terminated faculty over a five-year period in a single university. Findings: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results indicate traditional bibliometric indicators of h-index, publication count and citation count which are limited in their ability to identify performance differences between employment status cohorts. Results do show some promise for the newly developed hIa-index, as it is found to be significantly lower for terminated faculty (p < 0.001), as compared to both retained and resigned faculty. Multinomial logistic regression analysis also confirms the hIa metric as a predictor of terminated employment status. Research limitations/implications: First, the results imply that the hIa-index, which controls for career length and elements of coauthorship is a superior bibliometric indicator for comparison of research performance. Practical implications: Results suggest that the hIa metric may serve as a useful tool for the examination of employment decisions for universities. It also highlights the potential usefulness of bibliometric indicators for people analytics and the examination of employment decisions, performance management and faculty turnover in research-intensive higher education contexts.

Workforce analytics combines, the need for analyzing the human resource aptly and an adequate software that can provide us with sufficient insights to make fruitful decisions. Proper workforce planning through the usage of workforce analytics can lead to detailed evaluation of the abilities of the human resource, thereby resulting in a productive way of utilizing the abilities. Workforce analytics further enhances the productivity of the firm by identifying occasions, on which the workforce management proves to be inconsistent in terms of its processes, methodology or strategies. Workforce analytics falls under “People Analytics”, which is also referred to as HR Analytics. People Analytics combines data related to human resource from different sources, works on its accurate implementation and finding dependable and authentic results. The technology has become more reliable and enlightening in the recent years. Workforce Analytics is an emerging trend in HR. Along with it comes a set of challenges and opportunities, which demand to be understood before the trend could be turned into a fashion. The paper studies various aspects of Workforce Analytics and the need for it. As organizations grow, there HR grows too. The crucial role that the HR plays is being recognized and therefore the need to analyze it to improve the work performance has emerged. The paper also highlights the key elements that must be included for successful functioning of workforce analytics. The various elements include, flexibility, adaptability, usability, that are essential to the accomplishment of workforce analytics. The paper identifies the role of technology in the working of the software. The hitches that the organization faces can be overcome only if the software is supported by efficient technology. There are various reasons like scattered data, security, precision, etc. owing to which the role of an efficient as well as cost effective technology has magnified. The paper sheds light on such challenges that prove to be a main cause for the “strong popularity and steady growth” of workforce analytics. Since its new to the HR culture, the requirement to make individuals understand its essence and importance prevails. The organizations need to work towards creating an environment which accepts and uses the analytics, further implying the results upon their working style and ethic. The importance of communication within the organization has been brought into the lime light here. The need to bring the employees at ease with the software, to train them to use it well, and extracting the advantages out of it, are all things that can be put into practice if only strong communication flows through the organization. The advantages that it provides the organization with, are immense. Highlighting the advantages, the paper talks about how workforce analytics is not just useful for analyzing and studying the previous and the present outcomes, but it has a wider concept to it. The paper also proposes a workforce analytics model with major steps. The paper examines the advantages and the scope of putting Workforce Analytics and its tools to use. Analytics is widely used in the fields of marketing, sales, finance, investments etc, while in the field of human resource it is still taking its time. The growing awareness of its advantages is resulting in its gradual acceptance and adoption. Companies have begun hiring analytics professionals, and the rate at which they are doing so is a strong and positive indication of how well the organizations have received the concept of workforce analytics. The scope of workforce analytics is grand and the opportunities that lie ahead are great to exploit. The growing pace of how eager organizations are to utilize their human resource to its best capacity is giving rise to relentless competition among organizations. This will certainly bring a new age of analytics into action. The scope is wide and the trend has just begun. © 2020 IJSTR.","A; Attrition; Human resource management; People analytics; Workforce analytics; Workforce management; Workforce planning",""

The Quantified Self in Precarity highlights how, whether it be in insecure 'gig' work or office work, such digitalisation is not an inevitable process-nor is it one that necessarily improves working conditions. Indeed, through unique research and empirical data, Moore demonstrates how workplace quantification leads to high turnover rates, workplace rationalisation and worker stress and anxiety, with these issues linked to increased rates of subjective and objective precarity.

Scientific impact, particularly, plays a significant role in the academia. This paper attempts to understand researchers' career trajectories by considering the research community as a social network, where individuals build ties with each other via coauthorship. The resulting linkage facilitates information flow and affects researchers' future impact. Consequently, we systematically investigate the career trajectories of researchers with respect to research impact using the social capital theory as our theoretical foundation. Specifically, for early-stage and mid-career academics, we find that connections with prominent researchers associate with greater impact. Brokerage positions, in addition, are beneficial to a researcher's research impact in the long run. For senior researchers, however, the only social network feature that significantly affects their future impact is the reputation of their recently built ties. Finally, we build predictive models on future research impact which can be leveraged by both organizations and individuals. This paper provides empirical evidence for how social networks provide signals on researchers' career dynamics guided by social capital theory. Our findings have implications for individual researchers to strategically plan and promote their careers and for research institutions to better evaluate current as well as prospective employees. © 2020 Association for Information Science and Technology","","Information flows; Network features; Performance assessment; Predictive models; Research communities; Research impacts; Research institutions; Theoretical foundations; adult; article; career; employee; human; organization; social capital; social network; theoretical study; Predictive analytics"

In this work, data visualization techniques and machine learning algorithms have been used to predict employees stress levels. Based on data, we can develop a model that will assist to predict if an employee is likely to be under stress or not. Here, the XGB classifier is used for the prediction process and the results are presented showing that the method facilitates getting a more reliable model performance. After performing interpretation utilizing XGB classifier it is determined that working hours, workload, age, and, role ambiguity have a significant and negative influence on employee performance. The additional factors do not hold much significance when associated to the above discussed. Therefore, It is concluded that concluded that increasing working hours, role ambiguity, the workload would diminish employee representation in all perspectives. © 2020 IEEE.","Data Visualization; Employee stress; Machine Learning Algorithms; people analytics","Data visualization; Forecasting; Machine learning; Personnel; Employee performance; Prediction process; Professional life; Psychological stress; Reliable models; Role ambiguities; Visualization technique; Working environment; Learning algorithms"

Design/methodology/approach: Statistical analysis focused on observational data collected from user logs. Data are analyzed via regression models. Findings: Findings are presented for over 40,000 employees’ learning activity for one year in a multinational technology company. Variables including job level and tool use yielded a predictive model for overall learning behaviors. In addition, relevant differences are found for managers and nonprofessional learning. Research limitations/implications: Importantly, how well employees learned content was not measured. This research is also limited to observational relationships: for example, the online tools were used by self-selected users, instead of randomly assigned. Future research which randomly assigns tool use to employee subgroups could explore causal relationships.

This study is of considerable practical relevance as despite having numerous empirical research linking the positive impact of HR Analytics to organizational effectiveness and business competitiveness, the adoption and implementation rates of HR Analytics remain comparatively low. During the time we conducted the research, we faced several issues with the data collection process due to the novelty of the topic but also due to the relevancy and availability of research around the implementation and impact it has on businesses. The results indicate that despite the increase in popularity and interest in HRA, HR professionals still have a long way to go before reaching analytical maturity. Moreover, our research shows that HR is pivoting towards a more strategic function and playing a more curtail role in the organization’s decision making. Workforce Analytics is facing many challenges in regard to its implementation and our study highlights some of these obstacles such as a shortage in data analytics skills within HR, poor IT infrastructure, and insufficient investment from the business. As more organizations integrate analytics into their daily HR operations, we will start to see more challenges and obstacles that will completely change or even disrupt the way we know HR today.

However, are they looking at the most important metrics and more broadly, how should they identify employees to promote? The literature predominantly focuses on the measurement of performance, but businesses also need instruments that can predict management potential for promotional decision-making. This paper utilizes the data contained in the Human Resources Information System (HRIS) of a company to analyze drivers of potential for promotion among a sample of its workers. Numerous prior studies have been conducted of human resource variables in a variety of organizations. These studies share in common the use of linear models to report which explanatory variables are statistically significant determinants of the dependent variable - in most cases the performance of employees with a focus on the individual's output. What they do not deliver, and what this study provides, in addition to regression studies on employee performance, is an analysis of the drivers of promotion potential for management roles. The perspective of our analysis diverges from others in that its primary focus is to identify future leaders of a company rather than identifying strong individual contributors. The methods used consist of basic statistical procedures, multiple classification methods and graph theory analysis. In our study of managerial potential drivers, the logistic regression model performs with the best predictive accuracy and recognizes which factors in a manager reveals leadership potential. In our study of promotion potential from a teamwork perspective, we show that graph network-based methods adapt well to employee data containing several bilateral relationships while preserving the hierarchy of an organization and providing defensible accuracy. © 2020 IEEE.","classification; network analysis; people analytics; random forest; SVM","Graph theory; Logistic regression; Managers; Bilateral relationship; Employee performance; Explanatory variables; Leadership potential; Logistic Regression modeling; Multiple Classification; Predictive accuracy; Resources information; Decision making"

Toward this end, we use data on employee expertise to mathematically profile skill sets required for growth area jobs and develop a statistical scoring algorithm to prioritize internal candidates to be transferred to those growth area jobs.

In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking 'big' by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking 'deep' by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that 'business travel', which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention. © 2013 IEEE.","Deep people analytics; employee attrition; interpretation; policies recommendation; prediction; retention","Data Analytics; Deep learning; Forecasting; Large dataset; Personnel; Tourism industry; Attrition models; Critical problems; Data-driven approach; Ensemble learning; Exploratory research; Feature selection algorithm; Important features; Quantitative method; Advanced Analytics"
