Under this premise, the Iberoamerican Research Group of Multidisciplinary Studies on Happiness (IGOMSOH) was born with the purpose of exposing the intangible resource of happiness as an element of great social value in the era of Industry 4.0. Among its great academic achievements are the creation of the Felisofia brand, and the creation of the attractive concept of Happiness Management, as a multicultural management model aimed at providing incentives in the performance of the job for the following resources: creativity, commitment, technological innovation, internal entrepreneurship and social responsibility. In this way, the great circle of corporate happiness can be promoted within organizations. Bearing in mind that a society lacking for happy many people is a source for economic crisis, especially after Covid-19. © Peter Lang AG, International Academic Publishers, Bern 2021.

Success and resilience on this new level of societal evolution require organizational competences that are fundamentally different from transactional optimization and get rather undermined by our yet largely contest-based corporate cultures. System consciousness, corporate agility, and proactive collaboration can only emerge from an authentic collective focus and need to be fueled by intrinsic rather than extrinsic motivation - ultimately from a place of flow. The Gross Corporate Happiness® model represents the first integral framework that integrates all the key conditions for such a Flow Organization and provides the means to identify the relevant ""acupuncture points"" for an effective organizational transformation. In order to achieve a lasting shift in the traditional mental models, its introduction process ideally follows five distinct phases of a ""Hero's Journey"" that ensure that the change is fully embedded into the DNA of the organization: Identifying the Organizational Soul, Creating a Movement, Shifting from Control to Trust, Transforming the Organization into a Community, and Focusing Energy on a process of Continuous Evolution. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Agile organization; Bhutan; Collaboration; Corporate happiness; Corporate soul; Flow; Hero's journey; Intrinsic motivation; Organizational transformation; Self-determination theory; System thinking",""

Twelve key variables were identified, including ethics, global leadership, teamwork, effective communication, education/training, technology, sustainability, negotiation, financial management, productivity, decision-making, and corporate happiness, which are essential for the balanced growth of any organization. These variables represent the twelve hours of the corporate clock and, when properly managed, balancing the tangible and intangible aspects, they lead to long-term prosperous results. Additionally, connections were analyzed and established between these variables, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and Mercader’s Ethical Values Taxonomy. Questionnaires were administered to graduate professionals, using a Likert scale, to assess the need for these variables in companies. A total of 4,207 responses were obtained, which were analyzed along with the participants’ gender. The results provide an understanding of the priorities, realities, and relevance of the studied business variables. This research is novel, as it has not been previously conducted in its entirety or reflected upon the empirical data obtained. Despite their apparent simplicity, these data represent the realities and effects within the organizational and business environment. Therefore, this study is highly relevant for entrepreneurs, professionals, traders, entrepreneurs, educators, and others, as it enables self-analysis, the application of new experiences, and the attainment of benefits. © 2024; Los autores.","Company; Corporate Clock; Ethics; Sustainability; Well-Being",""

The theory around this leadership focus could change the way firms arrange their own business objectives and goals. In this paper, happiness, as a construct, is analyzed from an economical and entrepreneurial perspective. The goal is to determine if happiness influences productivity and work environments in technology-based firms (TBF) in Andalucia, Spain. A survey, completed by 41 employees, was elaborated on and applied to a group of employees in TBF, based in Sevilla. The results confirm that a happier environment is present in TBF than in non-technological firms. This is due to the strategies applied in TBF to improve happiness and wellness perception in their employees and the influence in productivity and, therefore, in organizational competitiveness. © 2018 IEEE.","Happiness Economics; Technology-based firms; Wellness Theory","Personnel; Business objectives; New approaches; Technology-based firms; Wellness Theory; Work environments; Productivity"

A business management model that aims to cement the corporate happiness of all the members of its organisation. Undoubtedly, a vital intangible resource to offer a service of excellence and quality to customers. As is well known, this is an aspect of particular relevance for haute cuisine restaurants. From this perspective, this paper arises from recent happiness management research that points to the need for a happy leadership style to actively reduce the psychological stress and physical exhaustion that chefs suffer daily in the kitchen. Inspired by the achievement of this goal, and therefore their happiness at work, this research conducts an exploratory study on how the dimensions: of organisational support, intraentrepreneurship and organisational justice empirically associate with the variable happiness at work. To this end, a structural equation model will be carried out based on the 136 surveys carried out on trainees at the Basque Culinary during the 2022–2023 academic years. The empirical results of this work show that the constructs of organisational support and organisational justice positively influence the happiness at work parameter. The same is not valid for the intrapreneurship factor. On the one hand, these findings can be exciting to demonstrate the complexity of generating a climate of subjective well-being within haute cuisine restaurants. Moreover, on the other hand, it shows that chefs are a source of culinary innovation and creativity when they carry out their professional activities in a positive and happy environment. © 2023","Basque culinary; Chefs; Happiness management; Intraentrepreneurship; Organisational justice; Organisational support",""
