In doing so, Peter A. Gloor introduces artificial intelligence-based methods to identify personality, moral values, and ethics of individuals based on their body language and interaction with others. In this book readers will:;understand the basic concepts of groupflow-when teams collaborate at their best through intrinsic motivation and positive stress;learn how to use artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and social network analysis (SNA) to analyze communication by tracking emotions, social networks, morals, and tribes;successfully use virtual mirroring to create entangled teams that work together in collaborative innovation networks (COINs) synchronized and in harmony for superior performance;understand how to implement virtual mirroring using these technologies. Groundbreaking and innovative, Happimetrics will be an invaluable resource for scholars and students in the fields of business analytics, information systems and organizational innovation. It will also be useful for HR professionals and AI developers who are looking to use predictive analytics to measure workforce performance. © Peter A. Gloor 2022. All rights reserved.","",""

Higher education can greatly benefit from knowledge management, which can support high-level planning and innovation while increasing efficiency, productivity, collaboration, and employee happiness. Without the use of KM in higher education they suffer for many reasons such as security, motivating people, keeping up with technology, measuring knowledge, dominating shared leadership, etc. As a result, it can be concluded that knowledge management has the primary role of educational institutions. The present research focuses on developing an innovative methodology based on advanced technology including “The Internet of Things” and “Artificial Intelligence” for the effective performance of KM in higher education systems. With the help of technology, this research helps educational institutions to understand how to analyze, collect, classify, and store the tacit knowledge recorded and through various activities carried out in the institutions for the staff and students. This methodology will help to index, share, repackage, and store. For better results, additional research methodologies were explored. It was including a detailed survey of available literature and collecting data from primary and secondary sources. The methodologies were explored by an amalgamated approach of advanced technology adaptation integrated with KM strategies. The proposed approaches have the potential to enhance administrative and academic services at reduced time and financial costs in the higher education system. The objectives of the present study are to design an effective tool for knowledge management and to transform unprocessed data into an information system that can be shared among the targeted group of individuals. The secondary objectives are based on experiences of comparable types, and that knowledge is stored in a reusable repository for the benefit of any future need. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Education; Higher education; IOT; Knowledge management; Technology","Artificial intelligence; Human resource management; Internet of things; Advanced technology; Business partners; Educational institutions; High educations; Higher education system; IOT; Knowledge management in higher educations; Management IS; Research focus; Technology; Knowledge management"
