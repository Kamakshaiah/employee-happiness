s,"Researchers in the field of HRM and Strategic HRM have for several decades engaged in research endeavours to identify the link between HR investments and firm performance. Despite this, the field still has some way to go to definitively demonstrate this causal relationship; partly due to the cross-sectional nature of much of this research. In the current paper, we give a brief overview of the SHRM field and the benefits that the new subfield of People Analytics (PA) might bring to the area. We also conduct a brief survey of research in Insider Econometrics, an approach used in Personnel Economics to produce empirical estimates of the value of HR practices, to highlight longitudinal intra-firm research in economics that could provide insights to research exploring the HR investment-performance link (important in both SHRM and PA fields). We discuss the value of combining the business impact perspective of People Analytics that has a unique ‘inside’ (intra-firm) position, with the longitudinal intra-firm analysis approaches utilized in Insider Econometrics. We suggest that People Analytics researchers, who are able to draw on the theoretical developments in HRM field, would benefit from exploring existing research insights and methodological techniques used within the field of Insider Econometrics. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
s,"HR analytics is an emerging field attracting substantial practitioner and academic attention. This article introduces the special issue on HR Aanalytics for the HRMJ. Several recent reviews in the area have struggled to find HR analytics research in the published literature and a key aim of this special issue is to show case high quality analytic projects and cutting-edge analytic techniques to contribute to this emerging subfield of HRM. Before considering the papers in the special issue, we reflect on two key challenges in the area: First, HR analytics is not a recognized keyword, this makes it difficult to categorise and identify HR analytics research in the field. Second, there are a growing number of reviews of a field that has a limited range of recognised examples of empirical papers to draw on. We discuss the difficulties and potential political sensitivities for practitioners seeking to publish ‘within firm’ HR analytics projects. We also consider the growing recognition that organisations engaging in HR analytics projects have a range of ethical challenges to deal with going forward. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
s,"Relational analytics—the leveraging of data on workplace relationships—acts as a complement to traditional people analytics and moves scholars and practitioners closer to an understanding of the realities of the modern workplace. This article serves as a primer for relational analytics by highlighting the potential of the perspective for human resources, the levels of analysis that can be used to study relational analytics, and some of the common theoretical perspectives employed in this area. We introduce the 15 articles in the special issue by positioning them within broader trends we see in the field of relational analytics. Finally, we provide commentary on challenges and future directions in relational analytics with a focus on how the articles in this special issue may serve as examples of best practices and inspiration for future research and practice. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
s,"For more than two decades, academicians and practitioners have been theorising the role of people analytics in enhancing the efficiency, effectiveness and impact of the human resource (HR) management function, thereby prescribing people analytics as an enabler of HR strategic partnership. The objective of this study is to identify and synthesise existing literature on people analytics and its conceptualised efficacy. This is done with a view to assess how and why people analytics enhances HR as a field and elevates it to a function of strategic significance. The study uses the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) framework for systematic literature review to address the research objective. A total of 90 articles on the subject are identified majorly from Scopus. The analysis of this literature reveals four significant themes underscoring the role people analytics can play in enabling HR as a field and function. These include the following: (a) application of people analytics leads to greater vertical, horizontal and external alignment of the HR function; (b) people analytics facilitates better integration of HR management with the organisation’s strategic planning process; (c) people analytics aids the demonstration of causal links between HR management and business performance; and finally (d) people analytics endows the field with scientific rigour, consistency and resulting credibility. The study contributes to the existing knowledge on people analytics and HR strategy linkage by building a foundation and offering specific propositions for empirical enquiry relating the two. The significance of the study also emanates from its focus on the efficacy of people analytics which is being viewed as an HR approach with immense potential. © The Author(s) 2022."
s,"The advancement of data technology such as machine learning and artificial intelligence has broadened the scope of human resources (HR) analytics, commonly referred to as “people analytics.” This field has seen significant growth in recent years as organizations increasingly rely on algorithm-based predictive tools for HR-related decision making. However, its application in the public sector is not yet fully understood. This study examined the concepts and practices of HR analytics through a thematic review, and proposed a five-step process (define, collect, analyze, share, and reflect) for implementation in the public sector—the process aims to assist with the integration of HR analytics in public personnel management practices. By analyzing cases in both the public and private sectors, this study identified key lessons for functional areas such as workforce planning, recruitment, HR development, and performance management. This research also identified the necessary conditions for introducing HR analytics in public organizations, including data management, staff capabilities, and acceptance, and discussed the potential challenges of privacy, integrity, algorithmic bias, and publicness. © 2023 by the authors."
s,"The aim of this paper is to review the current state of the art in the application of HR analytics in businesses as well as the potential implications for future work. A systematic literature review (SLR) method was used. The review comprised eight articles, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, from various industries and countries. The findings of this study revealed that HR analytics is becoming crucial for organizations as they strive to improve their ability to attract and retain skilled individuals in an increasingly competitive global environment. HR analytics may assist businesses in making more data-driven and strategic workforce management decisions such as talent acquisition, retention, training, and development. This study also discusses the potential ethical and legal issues related to the use of HR analytics. Overall, this paper recommends that the use of HR analytics will play a crucial role in the future of work, and that organizations should pay attention to the benefits of HR analytics and address the challenges that may arise in the future.  © 2023 IEEE."
s,"Purpose: This research analyzed the existing academic and grey literature concerning the technologies and practices of people analytics (PA), to understand how ethical considerations are being discussed by researchers, industry experts and practitioners, and to identify gaps, priorities and recommendations for ethical practice. Design/methodology/approach: An iterative “scoping review” method was used to capture and synthesize relevant academic and grey literature. This is suited to emerging areas of innovation where formal research lags behind evidence from professional or technical sources. Findings: Although the grey literature contains a growing stream of publications aimed at helping PA practitioners to “be ethical,” overall, research on ethical issues in PA is still at an early stage. Optimistic and technocentric perspectives dominate the PA discourse, although key themes seen in the wider literature on digital/data ethics are also evident. Risks and recommendations for PA projects concerned transparency and diverse stakeholder inclusion, respecting privacy rights, fair and proportionate use of data, fostering a systemic culture of ethical practice, delivering benefits for employees, including ethical outcomes in business models, ensuring legal compliance and using ethical charters. Research limitations/implications: This research adds to current debates over the future of work and employment in a digitized, algorithm-driven society. Practical implications: The research provides an accessible summary of the risks, opportunities, trade-offs and regulatory issues for PA, as well as a framework for integrating ethical strategies and practices. Originality/value: By using a scoping methodology to surface and analyze diverse literatures, this study fills a gap in existing knowledge on ethical aspects of PA. The findings can inform future academic research, organizations using or considering PA products, professional associations developing relevant guidelines and policymakers adapting regulations. It is also timely, given the increase in digital monitoring of employees working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. © 2021, Aizhan Tursunbayeva, Claudia Pagliari, Stefano Di Lauro and Gilda Antonelli."
s,"Over the last decade we have seen a significant shift in how organisations monitor and control their workforce. People analytics is becoming ever more extensive and invasive - from cameras checking if workers are at their desk to wearables reporting on worker wellness. We know little, however, on how such technologies of control are supporting management in making well informed decisions about their workers. Drawing from insights from a 16 month ethnographic study, we address this shortcoming through exploring how biometric data is being used to manage people in an elite sports organisation. Our study sheds light on a new form of control enacted through the use of biometric data - a shared control of the body - which calls for a closer relationship between managers and workers as they together attempt to control the body as the main subject of work performance. In particular, we follow the ways in which managers and workers negotiate towards a shared control of the body. Encompassing our findings as part of a theoretical model, we highlight how our findings have implications for theory on organisation control and resistance as well as for people analytics. © 2023, Academy of Management.

s,"In the machine learning process, sometimes due to vague assumptions, an algorithm that produces results that are prejudiced systematically is called an Algorithm Bias, Artificial Intelligence Bias, or Machine Learning Bias. There are several forms of Artificial Intelligence bias that promote gender biases. Machine learning models and training data sets are influenced by human developers’ cognitive biases. An algorithm gets hardcoded by such biases and incomplete data produces gender biases as well. If any information retrieved from a dataset is omitted by a cognitive bias, it brings biases. Thus, it is very important to ensure that the Artificial Intelligence data set should represent the complete population, and built-in biases must be overcome. In the present scenario, people’s behavior and opinions are very much influenced by Artificial Intelligence knowingly and unknowingly. In the design pattern of technologies, gender inequality has crept in due to the over-representation of men in the system. The present chapter focuses on the role of Artificial Intelligence and biased algorithms in the models of the Artificial Intelligence-based decision-making process. It is essential to understand as now Artificial Intelligence and HR/higher management are going together to manage human resources to enable organizations to achieve long-term goals. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."
s,"Attrition models combine variables into statistical algorithms to understand and predict employee turnover. People analytics teams and external vendors use attrition models to offer insights and to develop organisational interventions. However, if attrition models or other data-driven models inform employment decisions, model scores may then be subjected to civil rights laws and diversity concerns resulting from group differences in scores. This paper discusses adverse impact when building attrition models, outlining how researchers test for adverse impact in this context, strategies to reduce group differences and how attrition modelling and other human resources ‘big data’ predictions fit within larger validity frameworks. Procedures were applied to field data in an applied demonstration of an attrition model with disparate impact. Model revisions resulted in adverse impact reductions while simultaneously maintaining model validity. Collectively, this paper provides timely attention to important aspects of the people analytics, turnover and legal domains. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
s,"The main emphasis of this chapter is to identify the effect of motivation on variables of employee job performance in people analytics, which is seen as one of the major initiatives in human resources. The secondary sources have been utilised to identify the sources of the thematic approach. Considering this, the study explains how to determine the moderating factors in people analytics. The chapter offers an introduction to problem identification and focuses on detailed literature that helps in finding factors relevant according to the theme that has been elaborated in a thematic approach. A part of the Prisma model has been used to explain the four stages of literature identification. The moderating factors have been better explained through the case studies, and one case study has been explained in the context of an Indian scenario. While explaining the moderating factors, thematic methods have been used using manual screening. The major highlights have been reviewed, discussed, and summarised. © 2023, IGI Global.

s,"Background: Human resource management (HRM) is the tactical method for a business enterprise’s optimistic and systemic administration. This study aims to identify the common and major triggering attributes and the knowledge gap between HRM and an organisation’s employee attrition rate. Method: The employee Attrition Case Study Dataset used is an anecdotal data set that tries to figure out relevant variables that determine employee behavioural aspects towards attrition. This study investigates why attrition occurs, the major triggering attributes for employee turnover, and how it might be anticipated to employ artificial intelligence (AI) to avert corporate losses. Results: Employees’ monthly income, age, average monthly hours, distance from home, total working years, years at the company, per cent of salary hike, number of companies worked, stock options level, job role and other factors are taken into consideration. A feature importance extraction framework was devised to investigate the various dormant factors. The findings also show feasible hypotheses that help enhance employee engagement, reinvent the worker dynamic, and higher levels of risk decrease attrition rate. Implications: Employees’ monthly income, age, average monthly hours, distance from home, etc., are all major variables in employee attrition in the Indian IT business. This research adds to the theory development of behavioural elements in people analytics based on AI. Purpose: Can we predict employee attrition through employee behavioural patterns advancement using AI tools. © 2023 by Jada Kameswari, Hemant Palivela, Sreekanth Settur and Poonam Solanki."

s,"Each company tries its hardest to make the best use of its employees in order to accomplish the business's profitability. However, they encounter a number of issues unique to their best employees, which is frequently where people analytics comes into play. Day-to-day operations, procedural efficiencies, and other strategic operational challenges are handled by HR analytics. As a result, HR analytics considers all components of an organization at a high level, whereas work force analytics concentrates on personnel data such as engagement, job satisfaction, and success. The wide category of HR analytics includes labor force analytics. Employees leave for a number of reasons, including dissatisfaction with their pay, stagnant career advancement, and so on. A great defeat is possible for a firm to be profitable not just in terms of money, but also in terms of losing valuable employees. If the company determines whether or not that employee should be promoted, predicts what proportion of earnings that employee should receive, and determines whether or not that employee will leave the company in the near future, the company will work on employee retention in advance to keep their valuable and hardworking employees. Machine learning approaches might be used to forecast staff turnover and retention. Each modern organization accumulates a wide range of employee data; We'll utilize this data, analyze it, and extract insights from it so that the firm can make better decisions about how to conduct employees job.  © 2022 IEEE."
s,"People analytics or HR analytics have become the lifeblood of the mainstream HR tech. It has been playing a vital role in HR decision-making. With its varied functionalities, it is benefitting the organization in terms of task automation, improving employee experiences, measuring performance and analysing high employee turnover, etc. In the current business scenario analytics is the most important tool needed by a company to gain insights to take intelligent business decision. From static to descriptive, descriptive to predictive and finally predictive to prescriptive, people analytics has come a long way. Predictive people analytics helps in forecasting future for effective decision-making, whereas prescriptive people analytics provides intelligent recommendations for the minimal next steps to obtain desired results. This chapter is an earnest attempt in exploring the people analytics and its journey from predictive analytics to prescriptive analytics. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
s,"Purpose: This study aims to investigate the factors influencing the adoption of data analytics in performance management. By examining the role of organizational and environmental contexts, this study contributes to the existing literature by proposing a novel and detailed technology-organization-environment (TOE) model for the complex interplay between firm characteristics and the adoption of data analytics. The results offer valuable insights and practical implications for organizations seeking to leverage data analytics for effective performance management. Design/methodology/approach: The research draws upon a data set encompassing over 21,869 companies operating across all European Union member states. A multilevel logistic regression model was developed to evaluate the influence of organizational and environmental factors on the likelihood of adopting performance analytics in organizations. Findings: The findings indicate that the lack of awareness of the benefits of data analytics and its practical application to address specific business challenges is a significant barrier to its adoption. Organizational contexts, such as variable-pay systems, employee training, hierarchical structures and frequency of monetary rewards, also influence the adoption of data analytics. Research limitations/implications: The study informs managers about the strategic role of data analytics capabilities in performance management for improved business intelligence and driving data culture. Practical implications: The study helps managers understand the strategic role of data analytics capabilities in performance management, leading to improved business intelligence and fostering a data-driven culture in five key areas: structural alignment, strategic decision-making, resource allocation, performance improvement and change management. Originality/value: The study advances the TOE theory, making it a more detailed and complete framework, particularly applicable to the adoption of performance analytics. It identifies the main factors of adoption that play a crucial role in this process. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
s,"Organizations are transforming as they adopt new technologies and use new sources of data, changing the experiences of employees and pushing organizational researchers to respond. As employees perform their daily activities, they generate vast digital data. These data, when combined with established methods and new analytic techniques, create unprecedented opportunities for studying human behavior at work and have fueled the rise of people analytics as a new institutional field of practice. In this chapter, I describe the emerging field of people analytics and new organizational phenomena that accompany the use of data and algorithms. These practices are affecting how individuals, groups, and organizations function, ranging from decision-making processes and work procedures, to communication and collaboration, to attempts to monitor and control employees. In each of these domains, I describe recent research and propose new research directions. Many of these domains intersect with the emerging field of Computational Social Science, in which disciplinary scholars are applying computational methods to an expanding array of digitized data, pursuing interests that extend far into the organizational domain. Organizational scholars are well-positioned to bridge organizational and disciplinary advances to stay at the forefront of research on the future of work. © 2023 The Authors"
s,"Organisations are increasingly relying on people analytics to aid human resources decision-making. One application involves using machine learning to automatically infer applicant characteristics from employment interview responses. However, management research has provided scant validity evidence to guide organisations' decisions about whether and how best to implement these algorithmic approaches. To address this gap, we use closed vocabulary text mining on mock video interviews to train and test machine learning algorithms for predicting interviewee's self-reported (automatic personality recognition) and interviewer-rated personality traits (automatic personality perception). We use 10-fold cross-validation to test the algorithms' accuracy for predicting Big Five personality traits across both rating sources. The cross-validated accuracy for predicting self-reports was lower than large-scale investigations using language in social media posts as predictors. The cross-validated accuracy for predicting interviewer ratings of personality was more than double that found for predicting self-reports. We discuss implications for future research and practice. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
s,"Understanding how talent is attracted to companies and organizations is relevant. Additionally, it is critical to understand what keeps talent in organizations, something that Human Resource Management professionals have regularly debated over the past two decades. People, especially the younger and better prepared, change jobs today in a much more dynamic way than in the past, forcing organizations to face global competition, through strategies to maintain the high satisfaction of their teams and anticipate the intention talent output. The technology sector is one of the most targeted: the turnover of people is higher than in most sectors. This article seeks to understand how data analysis can help Human Resources Managers to perform their work better, either by knowing their teams or using people analytics to predict the change in their teams. It is hoped that this work will be a contribution to HRM and technology professionals, two areas in which it is essential that they dialogue in order to promote a better and more effective functioning of teams, whatever the sector is. © 2022 IEEE Computer Society.

s,"Recently, the field of human resource management (HRM) has undergone a significant transformation due to the impact of technological advances and increasing relevance of business analytics. Organizations worldwide are increasingly applying people analytics, which enables making more rational, objective and effective decisions about people based on the analysis of data. People analytics has a huge potential while dealing with unpredictable challenges organizations and their employees are facing today. On the one hand, people analytics can reveal the efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of the HRM function, especially emphasizing the strategic partnership role of human resource (HR) professionals. On the other hand, people analytics changes the way organizations identify, manage, develop and control their workforce. The term “people analytics” refers to a novel, evidence-based and data-driven approach to manage workforce. The focus is very much placed on workforce planning, recruitment and selection, development and training, and employee performance while analyzing data to establish causal relationships or other insights and accordingly drive actions by influencing the key decisions. However, applying people analytics involves numerous challenges revealing that not all organizations are on the same maturity level. Although previous research provides some theoretical insights regarding the implications of people analytics in HRM, empirical studies dealing with organizational examples and readiness to create business value through people analytics are nonetheless lacking. The chapter aims to reveal how people analytics is applied in the HRM field. While doing this, a qualitative research was conducted including 12 interviews with HR professionals from different organizations operating in various industries. The results revealed that organizations mainly used only descriptive analytics and the focus was more on HR metrics. In most cases, the decisions about workforce planning or employee remuneration were data-based. However, analytics was less used in employee selection and recruitment, and training and development areas. Not rare were the cases, when intuition of HR professionals or line managers drove the decisions. This chapter has strong practical implications seeing that the results can encourage organizations to rely more on people analytics to optimize the HRM function and add value to organizational success and employee well-being. In addition, the results draw attention to the potential challenges of people analytics organizations should take into considerations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."
s,"Knowledge is a crucial factor for organizations’ competitiveness in today's labour market and, through knowledge management, Human Resources Management (HRM) can be more useful and effective. For several reasons, Career Management is one of the HRM categories less structured and cared for by organizations. However, having information for the proper management of employees' careers is relevant and considered of high importance, given the impact it has on the development and retention of employees. The employees’ development includes increased knowledge, skills and abilities by each individual, which boosts the progression of his career. Managing knowledge from a perspective that accommodates career management seems to be structural for both organizations and their employees. Based on this premise, this article reviews the literature articulating five concepts: two from the knowledge theoretical field, such as Knowledge Management and Organizational Memory, and three from the HRM field, facing the topics of Talent Management, Career Management and People Analytics. The five concepts are explored, as are the relationships between them. The aim of this article translates into the interrelational description of the five concepts, to understand their common aspects and, thus, expand the approaches to Career Management. The concepts were linked in pairs, due to the absence of literature that addresses the five concepts simultaneously. The theoretical analysis allowed the construction of a conceptual model, which enables understanding of the conceptual convergences and divergences in the organizational and personal ecosystem, supported by local and global knowledge. The model presented will be useful to guide organizations in creating broad Knowledge Management systems, focusing on the people, thus enhancing their management and development. At the same time, it will also be useful for all employees since the model presented aims to contribute to the capitalization of their potential and personal achievement capacity within the organization. Future research may empirically validate the pertinence and applicability of this conceptual model. © 2022 Academic Conferences Limited. All rights reserved."

This also illustrates factors that impact the willingness of employees to enhance performance and tend to determine how analytics of Human Resources may prove a proposed recommendation to handle similar matters. © 2023 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

s,"Turnover contagion has created salient challenges for companies and society as turnover itself causes more turnover. Technically, due to the nonlinear growth of overall turnover rate within a short time, turnover is difficult to accurately predict. As a result, predicting and managing turnover contagion have become key issues in people analytics systems. However, existing studies on turnover contagion has primarily focused on its consequence such as time-lagged turnover, while how to identify turnover contagion effect and leverage it to improve the interpretability of turnover prediction algorithm remains under explored. Building upon the behavioral contagion theory, this research-in-progress paper proposes using machine learning method to calculate the turnover contagion effect based on the susceptible-infective epidemic model. This study lays a theoretical foundation to leverage social network data to examine turnover contagion, and practically contributes to managerial practice in designing turnover prediction systems for both efficiency and interpretability. © 2022 28th Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2022.

s,"Firms have recognized the opportunities presented by HR analytics; however, it is challenging for HR to convert their available data (sources) into meaningful strategical value. Moreover, research on the implementation and application of HR analytics is still in its infancy. Drawing on the socio-technical system perspective, we examine the implementation and application of HR analytics in firms. Based on a qualitative study with 17 HR analytics experts, we find that a shift to a more process-oriented perspective on HR analytics is needed. More precisely, besides the requirements for the analysis of data, the actual roles in the process of implementing and applying HR analytics need to be defined. In particular, this implies the interaction between the specialist department, the HR business partner and the HR analytics function. From a managerial perspective, we propose a process model for the future implementation and application of HR analytics. © 2022, The Author(s)."
s,"Technological advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) are heralding a new era of analytics and data-driven decision-making. Organisations increasingly rely on people analytics to optimise human resource management practices in areas such as recruitment, performance evaluation, personnel development, health and retention management. Recent progress in the field of AI and ever-increasing volumes of digital data have raised expectations and contributed to a very positive image of people analytics. However, transferring and applying the efficiency-driven logic of analytics to manage humans carries numerous risks, challenges, and ethical implications. Based on a theorising review our paper analyses perils that can emerge from the use of people analytics. By disclosing the underlying assumptions of people analytics and offering a perspective on current and future technological advancements, we identify six perils and discuss their implications for organisations and employees. Then, we illustrate how these perils may aggravate with increasing analytical power of people analytics, and we suggest directions for future research. Our theorising review contributes to information system research at the intersection of analytics, artificial intelligence, and human-algorithmic management. © 2021 The Author(s).

s,"At the intersection of technology and marketing, this study develops a framework to unobtrusively detect salespeople’s faces and simultaneously extract six emotions: happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, and disgust. The authors analyze 99,451 sales pitches on a livestream retailing platform and match them with actual sales transactions. Results reveal that each emotional display, including happiness, uniformly exhibits a negative U-shaped effect on sales over time. The maximum sales resistance appears in the middle rather than at the beginning or end of sales pitches. Taken together, the results show that in one-to-many screen-mediated communications, salespeople should sell with a straight face. In addition, the authors derive closed-form formulae for the optimal allocation of the presence of a face and emotional displays over the presentation span. In contrast to the U-shaped effects, the optimal face presence wanes at the start, gradually builds to a crescendo, and eventually ebbs. Finally, the study shows how to objectively rank salespeople and circumvent biases in performance appraisals, thereby making novel contributions to people analytics. This research integrates new types of data and methods, key theoretical insights, and important managerial implications to inform the expanding opportunity that livestream e-commerce presents to marketers to create, communicate, deliver, and capture value. © American Marketing Association 2021."
s,"For years we have known that effective organizational culture is critical to ensuring revenue growth, employee retention, and even stock price acceleration. Yet, culture change is hard. Today, in the hybrid world, most employees still spend the majority of their time working within small work teams, but team members are often remote from one another. These employee interactions are essential to sharing and modeling the norms and behaviors necessary to cultivate the desired culture. Combining behavioral data with the use of organizational network analysis helps to overcome these limitations and provides a deeper understanding of the employee cultural experience—even in the hybrid context. In our research, we evaluated 10 attributes critical to an organization's culture from more than 50,000 employees across three years. Using passive data, we also re-constructed the employee network based on primary interactions. Our research highlighted three critical cultural patterns that will help to more deeply evaluate culture in a hybrid context, but even more importantly,help target local solutions that can be quickly implemented. We call these the three“C's” of cultivating culture. We show that organizational culture clusters in the employee network, is contagious among employees, and is contextually dependent.We discuss our key insights on the three C's, concluding with practical applications for leaders applying these insights in their organization. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."
s,"This article is about a training project within a leading Italian insurance company, based on people analytics and a blended learning program enhanced by e-REAL® and artificial intelligence. The intervention started with an Organizational Network Analysis regarding informal and spontaneous communication from which skills and ideas arise: this is the starting point that allows the HR Team to take decisions and outline strategies to support growth. Then, a Sentiment Analysis was performed, in order to track and monitor the climate in different clusters within the company, by mapping sentiment through natural language processing algorithms (all data anonymized). This step also opened to a Tensions Analysis targeting expressions of anger or misalignment with the corporate culture. As a further step, an Employees Potential Chart was developed. As an output of this phase, the HR Team was provided with essential metrics such as performance peaks, relational networks, communication and collaboration among teams and departments, key competencies, and skills. Then, a learning and development plan based on people analytics was designed: the main elements were interactive tutorials and immersive online experiences made by a multimedia and visual storytelling approach, as well as an extensive interaction within an escape room animated also by realistic avatars. A number of other methodologies were introduced as a further step: first of all training on-the-job, coaching, and mentoring. All the interventions were based on a large amount of people analytics collected from gamified activities, allowing for micro-targeted and highly precise interventions that are very innovative in the field of learning and development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
s,"Does human reflexivity disappear as datafication and automation expand and machines take over decision making? In trying to find answers to this question, we take our lead from recent debates about People Analytics and analyze how the use of algorithmically driven digital technologies like facial recognition and drones in work-organizations and societies at large shape the conditions of ethical conduct. Linking the concepts of algorithmic governmentality and space of ethics, we analyze how such technologies come to form part of governing practices in specific contexts. We conclude that datafication and automation have huge implications for human reflexivity and the capacity to enact responsibility in decision making. But that itself does not mean that the space for ethical conduct disappears, which is the impression left in some literatures, but rather that is modified and (re) constituted in the interplay of mechanisms of closure (like automating decision making, black boxing and circumventing reflexivity), and opening (such as disclosing contingent values and interests in processes of problematization, contestation and resistance). We suggest that future research investigates in more detail the dynamics of closure and opening in empirical studies of the use and effects of algorithmically driven digital technologies in organizations and societies. © The Author(s) 2022."

s,"Increasingly digital workplaces enable advanced people analytics (PA) that can improve work, but also implicate privacy risks for employees. These systems often depend on employees sharing their data voluntarily. Thus, to leverage the potential benefits of PA, companies have to manage employees’ disclosure decision. In literature, we identify two main strategies: increase awareness or apply appeal strategies. While increased awareness may lead to more conservative data handling, appeal strategies can promote data sharing. Yet, to our knowledge, no systematic overview of appeal strategies for PA exists. Thus, we develop an initial taxonomy of strategies based on a systematic literature review and interviews with 18 experts. We describe strategies in the dimensions of values, benefits, and incentives. Thereby, we present concrete options to increase the appeal of PA for employees. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
s,"The digital transformation of organizations is boosting workplace networking and collaboration while making it “observable” with unprecedented timeliness and detail. However, the informational and managerial potential of work datafication is still largely unutilized in human resource management (HRM) and its benefits, both at the individual and the organizational level, remain largely unexplored. Our research focuses on the relationship between digitally tracked work behaviors and employee attitudes and, in so doing, it explores work datafication as a source of data-driven HRM policies and practices. As a chapter of a wider research program, this paper presents some data analysis we performed on a collection of enterprise collaboration software (ECS) data, in search for promising correlations between behavioral and relational (digital) work patterns and employee attitudes. To this end, the digital actions performed by 106 employees in one year are transformed into a graph representation in order to analyze data under two different points of view: the individual (behavioral) perspective, according to the user who performed the action and the performed action, and the social (relational) perspective, making explicit the interactions between users and the objects of their actions. Different employees’ rankings are thus derived and correlated with their attitudes. Finally, we discuss the obtained results and their implications in terms of people analytics and data-driven HRM. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
s,"Changing technology and the growing demand for workforce intelligence have ushered in a new era of human resource (HR) transformation and have compelled HR professionals to continually ideate, innovate, and adapt. This book covers the changing role of HR in the transformation of workplaces to be successful globally. With challenges come new opportunities for HR to completely transform. Currently, technology is considered to be an extension of human beings rather than an external component, which makes people less socially connected. Physical, psychological, and financial well-being in this machine-led world is driving the agenda of HR. Individuals with complex business requirements and long-term goals must coexist with the gig economy, flexible workplaces, and changing priorities. This book precisely addresses these issues. More innovations are needed to create solutions for an ever-growing digital world. This book, therefore, explains how the role of HR executives must be to understand how emerging technologies are affecting company culture, strategy, operational plans, and the hiring of future talent. Crafting a career path for knowledge workers with challenging roles with fulfilling job aspects remains a puzzle. Keeping people engaged and happier is one of the major challenges that HR professionals experience. Different generations in the workplace with differing styles of learning, communication, and dynamic expectations add to these challenges. HR functions must keep evolving to overcome these challenges to transform the workplace, and it is essential to recognize how HR can act as a strategic business advisor through the effective use of technology. This book provides practical advice in these areas. In addition, this book helps professionals, researchers, and practitioners understand the way advanced technology and automation are influencing HR practices and processes in the new normal. The topics are designed to capture the most advanced technology-based HR practices for workplace transformations in industry and academia. This book assembles contributions from experts in HR planning, human capital management, business analytics, people analytics, predictive analysis, and automation from across the world, contributing their knowledge to identify the different attributes of the above-mentioned field of study. The book’s chapters are designed and organized pragmatically to enhance the reader’s experience and interest, reflecting upon a few untouched segments in the HR domain such as HR data privacy, data security, diversity, and inclusion using explainable AI (XAI), blockchain, and metaverse. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Anamika Pandey, Simon Grima, Suruchi Pandey & Balamurugan Balusamy."
s,"A Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) Learner's journey was driven primarily through the 'traditional' classroom environment, which is not conducive to modern learner learning needs. These face-to-face interactions have limited technology interfaces and do not meet the evolving demands of the present-day learner to upskill fast, improve employee engagements, and create efficiencies in Learning & Development. With PDO re-shapes its strategy to accelerate and evolve to energy efficiency, renewables, and decarbonisation, it is essential that employees also have the necessary skills to succeed. Therefore, PDO's Learning & Development (L&D) Academy had to re-shape its strategy on how it embraces innovations and technologies to serve modern learners best. Boost side-lined skills, so digital technology becomes part of the workforce's everyday working & learning lives. PDO's L&D provides a unique learning experience for each learner to cater for changes to the learning preferences of the modern learner, who not only want the latest learning programs to take place anywhere but also requires more personalised opportunities for engaging with their peers. PDO's L&D Academy has adopted a bifocal approach to create and sustain an innovative learning technology culture. The first part is the integration of PDO's Learning Management Systems (LMS) with other HR modules such as performance, and people analytics, which will provide PDO's employees with an integrated talent system. The second part is the transformation of PDO's Learning Technology Ecosystem, and this involves creating a pool of learning modalities leveraging technology to deliver immersive, contextual, and personalised learnings. PDO's L&D Academy has set up a Creative Multimedia Lab (CML) to introduce the various learning modes. The CML brings awareness to the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) to a broader population in PDO. It also provides the opportunity to demonstrate how can utilise these technologies to customise and enhance learning and the learner's experience. Developing these customised learnings will bring a superior experience to the learners and hence implant lifelong learning in the flow of work cultures in PDO in the long run.

s,"Technology-mediated change management (TMCM) refers to an organization's use of digital technologies to facilitate change implementation. The use of digital technology is deeply penetrating change practice. However, alarmingly, few have theorized about or empirically investigated TMCM. A rich body of research informs change management, however, less is known about how technologies are changing the nature of managing the change itself. We stimulate new conversations on this topic by discussing how TMCM provides both valuable benefits and creates new risks in terms of the (a) adaptiveness, (b) personalization, and (c) openness of the change process. TMCM requires urgent attention as it has the potential to help shape the future of change research and practice. We call for scholarship that is reflexive about both the benefits and risks associated with TMCM and we offer directions for research in this relatively new area that may very well determine the future of our field. © The Author(s) 2021."
s,"The field of analytics has seen tremendous growth in the past decade. Beginning with marketing and supply chain analytics, the application of analytics in human resources has shown lots of benefits for organizations. Research and application of HR analytics have substantiated its significant impact on organizational performance (Chierici et al., Management Decision 57:1902-1922, 2019). Analytics has the potential to generate insights for driving individual and group performance. The chapter discovers the importance of people analytics for performance management and the metrics used by organizations for measuring employee engagement and performance management. The chapter also covers how predictive analytics can be applied to determine the factors that are responsible for individual or team performance. The insights generated can be beneficial to the organizations in numerous ways if effectively implemented. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."
s,"Purpose: This research aims to explore whether or how organizations adopt people analytics (PA), its value and potential socio-technical factors that can enable or hinder PA projects by disrupting and reshaping human resource management. We do this by focusing on the Italian context. Design/methodology/approach: We conduct a scoping review of data collected between 2018 and 2022 via Google Alerts (GA), a content change detection and notification service that is gaining popularity in scholarly research. Findings: Our findings suggest that the diffusion of PA applications in Italy, especially those of a descriptive nature, is growing. Most of the existing PA applications are positioned in a positive technocratic light, envisioning the value of PA for both employees and organizations. The value for the latter appears to be direct, while the value for employees is realized through organizational initiatives. The findings also suggest that while enablers can vary between PA application types, the barriers, especially technological and environmental, are generic for both descriptive and predictive/prescriptive PA applications. Originality/value: Theoretically, we propose a framework for analyzing PA applications, their values, enablers and barriers. Methodologically, we present and describe in detail a novel approach, drawing on GA that can be used to study PA in specific contexts. Practically, our study serves as a helpful point of reference for managers planning or implementing PA in Italy, for benchmarking PA in Italy over time and for comparative international studies. © 2024, Stefano Di Lauro, Aizhan Tursunbayeva, Gilda Antonelli and Luigi Moschera."
s,"Recent developments in text mining and natural language processing (NLP) have paved a new way for analysing text data. These techniques are particularly useful for human resource management (HRM) due to the large amount of text information in the field. This paper adds to the literature by introducing and demonstrating steps of using NLP. Two demonstrations are presented: Demonstration One illustrates how simple and straightforward Bag-of-Word models applied on textual comments can be used to predict numerical ratings of companies; Demonstration Two shows how personality (self-reported scores on the Big Five) can be predicted from situational interview questions through more complex Doc2Vec algorithms. Together, these demonstrations show that both simple and complex techniques are effective tools in predicting organizational outcomes.

s,"With increasingly digitalized workplaces, the potential for sophisticated analyses of employee data rises. This increases the relevance of people analytics (PA), which are tools for the behavioral analysis of employees. Despite this potential, the successful usage of PA is hindered by employee concerns. Especially in Europe, where the GDPR or equivalent laws apply, employee consent is required before data can be processed in PA. Therefore, PA can only provide relevant insights if employees are willing to share their data. One potential way of achieving this is the use of appeal strategies. In the design of PA, the core strategy that can be used is the inclusion of data owner benefits, such as automated feedback, that are given to employees in exchange for sharing their own data. In this paper, we examine benefits as an appeal strategy and develop four design principles for the inclusion of benefits in PA. Then, we describe an exemplary set of analyses and benefits, demonstrating how our principles may be put into practice. Based on this exemplary implementation, we describe and discuss the results of a user study (n = 46) among employees in the EU and UK. Our study investigates the factors that foster or hinder employees' consent to sharing their data with PA. Then, we introduce our data owner benefits and analyze whether they can positively influence this consent decision. Our introduced data owner benefits were, contrary to our expectations, not suited to motivate our participants to consent to sharing their data. We therefore analyze how participants judge the benefits. Participants generally appreciate having them, confirming the value of including data owner benefits when designing PA. Some of our introduced benefits negatively influenced participants' sharing decision, though, meaning that careful consideration of potential risks is required when conceptualizing them.  © 2023 ACM."
s,"Modern organizations have a multitude of technological tools at their disposal to augment decision-making processes, with artificial intelligence (AI) standing out as a pivotal and extensively embraced technology. Its application spans various domains, including business strategies, organizational management, and human resources. There's a growing emphasis on the significance of talent capital within companies, and the rapid evolution of AI has significantly reshaped the business landscape. The integration of AI into HR functions has notably streamlined the analysis, prediction, and diagnosis of organizational issues, enabling more informed decision-making concerning employees. This study primarily aims to explore the factors influencing employee attrition. It seeks to pinpoint the key contributors to an employee's decision to quit an organization and develop a futuristic data driven model to forecast the possibility of an employee leaving the organization. The study involves training a model using an employee turnover dataset from IBM analytics, including a total of thirty-five features and approximately one thousand and five hundred samples. Post-training, the model's performance is assessed using classical metrics. The Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier emerged as the algorithm delivering the most accurate results for the specified dataset. It notably achieved the best recall (0.54) indicating its ability to correctly identify positive observations and maintained false negative of merely 4.5%. © 2023 IEEE."
s,The pandemic aroused the need for hybrid working model and has placed organizations to adapt to the evolving changes and demonstrate resilience to deliver better results. The purpose of this paper is to showcase the importance of how a combination of artificial intelligence and analytics helps the organization in engaging the talent in the hybrid workplace. This study used a structured interview process to collect primary data and draw inferences. The data samples collected for this study were from the HR managers to understand how AI tools and analytics has contributed significantly in the employee engagement domain as compared to the traditional approach that was used before pandemic. The paper draws its focus primarily to the IT industry in Indian context where cutting edge technology is transforming the way HR will function. This study provides suitable recommendations based on findings after the in-depth interviews and extensive research of the literature.  © 2022 IEEE.
s,"Data Analysis has been one of the most internal themes of the times. In the Digital Transformation that we live in today, there are several and varied as its implementations. However, in Human Resources, even though Human Resource Management Systems (HRIS) is already rooted, the development of data analysis is slow to appear. This is due to the scepticism existing in the area's professionals regarding People Analytics and the ethical issue of reducing people to data. This work discusses what People Analytics is, what topics can be developed, how HRIS can be transformed and what the future this area will have within companies. This work intends to contribute in this topic discussion, since it is relevant on Human Resources Management jobs, but also on the technological functions, mainly on information systems implementation to data collection, and in data analytics, both to promote data-driven approaches and decisions. © 2022 IEEE Computer Society.

s,"Organizations use People Analytics (PA) to pursue strategic planning of their activities. PA offers a strategic view of the organization, including the understanding of people's behavior. This article presents a new probabilistic approach to map behavioral profiles. It collects self-perception of personality traits and classifies persons into four archetypes. Additionally, it computes behavior characteristics at different intensities, generating nine situational indicators, such as energy and motivation. Our approach also presents thirteen areas of talent and their relationship to the behavioral profiles. We also test the assertiveness of our proposed approach by statistically evaluating it considering the perspectives of employees, employees leaders, and expert psychologists. Experimental results show that our approach is effective, achieving 93.22% ± 3.06% agreement for observed employees, 90.80% ± 4.60% for leader observers, and 93.66% ± 1.28% for expert observers.  © 2023 IEEE."
s,"This article reports on a participant ethnography of a people analytics (PA) team operating within the human resources (HR) function of a European multinational corporation at the cutting edge of PA development. Despite their analytical expertise, this team experienced significant dissonance between their desired image of PA work and the actualities of PA practice. Our analysis explains this dissonance through two prevalent identity performance scripts: ‘customerization’ and ‘action-orientation’. Taken together these scripts were identified as having a restrictive impact on the production of more scientifically rigorous PA work. Further, both of these scripts were found to be imbued with cynicism, whereby PA practitioners distance themselves from the commercial presentation of their work outputs. The article reveals how management preferencing of presentational and commercial considerations over those of scientific rigour may result in a failure to generate the level of organisational benefits promoted by the optimistic accounts in current literature, with negative implications for the reputational profile of PA. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
s,"Purpose: The metaverse, through artificial intelligence (AI) systems and capabilities, allows considerable data analysis in the workplace, largely exceeding traditional people analytics data collection. While concerns over surveillance and issues associated with privacy and discrimination have been raised, the metaverse has the potential to offer opportunities associated with fairer assessment of employee performance and enhancement of the employee experience, especially with respect to gender and race, inclusiveness and workplace equity. This paper aims at shedding light on the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) opportunities and challenges of implementing the metaverse in the workplace, and the role played by AI. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on our past research on AI and the metaverse and provides insights addressed to human resources (HR) scholars and practitioners. Findings: Our analysis of AI applications to the metaverse in the workplace sheds light on the ambivalent role of and potential trade-offs that may arise with this emerging technology. If used responsibly, the metaverse can enable positive changes concerning the future of work, which can promote DEI. Yet, the same technology can lead to negative DEI outcomes if implementations occur quickly, unsupervised and with a sole focus on efficiencies and productivity (i.e. collecting metrics, models etc.). Practical implications: Managers and HR leaders should try to be first movers rather than followers when deciding if (or, better, when) to implement metaverse capabilities in their organizations. But how the metaverse is implemented will be strategic. This involves choices concerning the degree of invasive/pervasive monitoring (internal) as well as make or buy decisions concerning outsourcing AI capabilities. Originality/value: Our paper is one among few (to date) that discusses AI capabilities in the metaverse at the intersection of the HR and information systems(IS) literature and that specifically tackles DEI issues. Also, we take a “balanced” approach when evaluating the metaverse from a DEI perspective. While most studies either demonize or celebrate these technologies from an ethical and DEI standpoint, we aim to highlight challenges and opportunities, with the goal to guide scholars and practitioners towards a responsible use of the metaverse in organizations. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited."
s,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the workplace and changed how human resources (HR) are managed erstwhile. Workforce analytics encompasses a series of interventions used to describe, diagnose, predict, and prescribe the core HR management (HRM) in an organization. Organizations need to engage in advanced data analysis to provide actionable insights to the HR teams in organizations. “AI” is gradually becoming a novel hotspot technology everywhere. The use of big data to provide information and pieces of evidence regarding the operation of the complete system is a key strategic component of HR metrics and workforce analysis. This chapter aids to provide a better understanding of how to strengthen HRM using AI technology. Workforce analytics is a strategic imperative; the chapter explores and discusses the potential of an AI-powered workforce analytics framework in organizations. Workforce analytics is a unified system of engaging organizations’ workforce to enable increased productivity and superior workforce experience. However, workforce management, workplace dynamics, and organizational changes face challenges while implementing technology. Next, the chapter also deals with how organizations are purpose-driven, resilient, and adaptable to dynamic environments toward the organization’s growth. By breaking the myths and biases in AI-based workforce analytics, this chapter pioneers in providing insights about transformational strategies for AI-based workforce management. This chapter discusses the complex relationship between AI, workforce analytics, and its challenges. The study extends to understanding the potential of AI-based workforce analytics and its way forward in HRM. Briefly, this chapter offers a framework that integrates the potential application of AI in workforce analytics in HRM, obstacles while developing an AI-based workforce analytics platform and breaking the myths and biases in workforce analytics. The chapter also covers the organizational policies for AI-based workforce analytics; finally, it contributes to how AI is transforming HR: the future of people analytics and conclusion.

s,"This study expects to systemically review the current investigations on the relationship of people analytics adoption to support higher education's competitive advantage. Through a systematic literature review, with the help of Publish or Perish v8 Software, the assessment chose 19 papers, then played out a descriptive analysis of the writing to address the accompanying exploration questions: 1) what people analytics implies and its significance, and 2) what can People Analytics give to higher education competitive advantage? Researchers did a far-reaching writing audit investigation to accomplish the referenced targets of the paper. Given the examination, the adoption of people analytics to support higher education competitive advantage centers around instructing and learning investigation. The level of analytics is used primarily in the descriptive and diagnostics area. The predictive and prescriptive analytics were not much discussed. The empirical papers of this people analytics range from subject matters to data storage in the library business unit.

s,"Employees work in increasingly digital environments that enable advanced analytics. Yet, they lack oversight over the systems that process their data. That means that potential analysis errors or hidden biases are hard to uncover. Recent data protection legislation tries to tackle these issues, but it is inadequate. It does not prevent data misusage while at the same time stifling sensible use cases for data. We think the conflict between data protection and increasingly data-driven systems should be solved differently. When access to an employees' data is given, all usages should be made transparent to them, according to the concept of inverse transparency. This allows individuals to benefit from sensible data usage while addressing the potentially harmful consequences of data misusage. To accomplish this, we propose a new design approach for workforce analytics software we refer to as inverse transparency by design. To understand the developer and user perspectives on the proposal, we conduct two exploratory studies with students. First, we let small teams of developers implement analytics tools with inverse transparency by design to uncover how they judge the approach and how it materializes in their developed tools. We find that architectural changes are made without inhibiting core functionality. The developers consider our approach valuable and technically feasible. Second, we conduct a user study over three months to let participants experience the provided inverse transparency and reflect on their experience. The study models a software development workplace where most work processes are already digital. Participants perceive the transparency as beneficial and feel empowered by it. They unanimously agree that it would be an improvement for the workplace. We conclude that inverse transparency by design is a promising approach to realize accepted and responsible people analytics.  © 2023 ACM."
s,"Companies are increasingly turning to AI software to select candidates, despite concerns that hiring algorithms may produce biased evaluations. This study explores the public perceptions of algorithms used in resume and video interview screening. In addition, the effects of individual characteristics on these perceptions are examined. Using a nationally representative sample, we find that the public generally has a negative attitude towards the use of algorithms in hiring, and the majority do not consider them fair and effective. We also find clear individual differences regarding the perceptions towards algorithms. Specifically, males, people with higher education level and people with higher income have more positive perceptions towards hiring algorithms than their counterparts. The findings contribute to the emerging body of research on hiring algorithms and suggest strategies to increase public acceptance of hiring algorithms. © 2022"
s,"Technological developments encourage organizations to change the way they work. The function of Human Resources management or now known as Human Capital (HC) has also developed. Decision making, which was usually based on intuition alone, now relies heavily on the use of data especially with the emergence of data analytics for HC which many calls it People Analytics. In building an effective People Analytics, the need for data governance becomes important as data is the main source of information for analysis. The intense use of data becomes a challenge for companies, especially in terms of governance. The DAMA-DMBOK 2 data governance framework model which focuses on 10 data management functions was chosen as it can be adapted to HC context. Each of the management functions within the framework were adopted into several focuses on data management in the context of HC. In applying the concept of data governance, a hierarchy model for data governance operations was chosen as it serves as a guideline for cascading process that covers from the top level into the most basic level of data governance practices. HC data governance was applied using the modified DAMA-DMBOK 2 and can be felt into several levels. However, the limitation of using DAMA-DMBOK 2 framework is that it only focuses on data management focusing on HC, and the framework proposed in this paper is designed for large established companies. © 2022 ACM."

s,"Digitalization is enormously changing the workforce: its size was reduced, as more and more tasks are automated, and an increasingly specialized staff is required for the remaining ones. Work environments have also been impacted by the phenomenon, which has completely transformed the way employees interact with each other, the information they use to perform their jobs, their attitudes toward their careers, and their expectations towards their employers. Many of these changes are due to new technological advances and to the increasing availability of HR data, and this trend is likely to increase further in the future. In fact, with the advancement of digitization, new sources of structured and unstructured data are becoming accessible to HR practitioners, enabling them to analyze the complexity of HR decision making more deeply. Organizations have at their disposal a wealth of information related to their workforce and organizational performance, as well as various external sources that, when combined, can be treated as big data that can offer useful information for business-driven decision-making, if approached with the appropriate analytical tools. HR departments are thus facing a period of transformation in order to take advantage of the opportunities arising from the aforementioned innovations, as well as to deal with increasingly numerous and complex challenges. HR department members must not miss the important opportunity for professional growth offered by digital transformation. Despite the obvious difficulty in adapting to this relatively recent phenomenon, which to be fully exploited requires skills that until now were not required to them, HRs will have to work hard to claim the legitimacy of conducting operations with a new data-driven approach, developing the necessary skills. This should therefore not be seen as a complication of their duties, but as the long-awaited opportunity to finally consolidate the strategic importance of the function. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

s,"Technological advances and the “zeitgeist” led to increased use of AI in HR Analytics. Using machine learning models in this field might be beneficial but requires some unique considerations in how organizations govern, assure, audit, and support the use of AI. While substantial work has been done on AI ethics, organizational implantation studies are rare and often anecdotal, particularly in HR. In this article, we would like to better understand the common ethical considerations and organizational responses for developing AI for HR use and how different organizations engage with them by comparing two case studies. This paper begins by reviewing AI ethical issues specific to HR and describes the common mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. After this introduction, case studies are illustrated, and the organizational responses in both cases are analyzed. The discussion section shows that although the organizations were aware of the AI ethics issues, their responses varied and depended on different governance and self-regulation mechanisms that might have impinged their ability to proactively engage with ethical issues. A second finding is that the organization used only a relatively small set of mitigation strategies proposed in the literature, and we propose several reasons for this. These insights might be important to various organizations deploying or developing AI for HR use that want better governance, assurance, and audit mechanisms to responsibly address the ethical issues raised by AI in this field. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"
s,"This study explores the influence of data-driven talent management practices on eco-innovation in state- owned enterprises. A literature review was conducted to examine the role of people data, HR metrics, and people analytics in enhancing talent management practices and eco-innovation in state-owned enterprises. Findings revealed that people data is essential for making talent decisions and developing effective talent retention strategies. Additionally, two key drivers of eco-innovations were identified and grouped into external and internal drivers. External drivers include environmental regulations, competition pressures, and customers' demands for eco-friendly products and services. Internal drivers are organizational capabilities, technological capabilities, and corporate social responsibility. Therefore, data-driven talent development interventions are necessary for advancing organizational and technological capabilities to boost eco-innovation performance in state-owned enterprises. © 2024, IGI Global.

s,"Organizations increasingly offer resources to improve performance, minimize costs, and achieve better results. An organization is the individuals who work or provide services in it. Therefore, good organizational performance directly results from the good work of its collaborators. Identifying the archetype in the business environment can combine individuals with companies, which can improve the organizational environment and enhance the development of the individual. A person leaves traces of his behavior in what he produces, such as videos and texts. Some studies point to the possibility of identifying a behavioral profile from a textual production. In this work, we seek to identify the archetype of individuals within the business environment based on their curriculum texts. We combine the behavioral profile assessment (BPA) archetypes (Planner, Analyst, Communicator, and Executor) with 26, 636 curriculum to apply machine learning models. For this task, we used classification and regression approaches. The main algorithm used for the approaches was the SVM. The results suggest that the archetypes are better modeled using regression techniques, obtaining an MSE of 4.49 in the best case. We also provide a visual explanation example to understand the model outputs. Copyright © 2023 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda. Under CC license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)"

s,"Series of reports on AI misconduct from multiple renowned organizations have triggered a surge of public awareness, calling for more responsible and sustainable use of AI. Noting socially responsible AI (SRAI) as a new concept in the field of PA and HRD, we delved into the subject through an integrative literature review of 75 articles and incorporated three sustainability concepts into AI-enabled PA: corporate social responsibility (CSR), environment, social, and governance (ESG), and UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). Through a stakeholder view, we identified major SRAI stakeholders (subjects) and analyzed their essential considerations (objectives), the impediments of AI technology (causes), and the solutions (means). The analysis illuminated key requirements and considerations for enhancing AI-enabled PA to SRAI-empowered PA towards sustainability. Moreover, we proposed a holistic framework to thoroughly understand SRAI in theory and provided practical implications, recommendations, and future research directions for HRD scholars and professionals. © The Author(s) 2023."
s,"People analytics depicts the algorithmization of human resources management characterized by the data-driven automation and support of people-related processes or tasks. On the one hand, people analytics promises productivity increases through optimizing workforce planning, hiring, or talent development. On the other hand, the extensive data collection and analysis of employees’ behaviors can be perceived as invasive, raising privacy concerns. This debate cannot only be explained by diverging norms and values, for example, practitioners realizing commercial opportunities while being criticized by academic commentaries. Instead, an alternative explanation suggests that the opposing views can be reconciled by diving into the conceptual differences regarding what analytical methods and data sources people analytics entails. Hence, this paper proposes the conceptions of operational and strategic people analytics based on a literature review of academics’ and practitioners’ literature. Four propositions about these conceptions’ privacy and performance implications are derived. Future research should empirically validate these propositions. © BLED 2022. All rights reserved."
s,"This case will allow students to have insight about how transformative HR is leveraging employee data to make evidence-based strategic decisions. Berger, striving to increase turnover every four years, faced HR challenges with manual processes and disconnected data across departments. HR functions were hindered by the lack of integration. To address this, Berger implemented SAP SuccessFactors, automating data collection and analysis across departments. The system provides a unified platform for evaluating performance, streamlining recruitment, and aligning employee goals with company strategy. This HR transformation enhances efficiency, eliminates manual updates, and ensures consistency in tracking employees. The move reflects a strategic response to increased customer demand while maintaining product and service quality, offering valuable insights for undergraduate and postgraduate human resource management courses. This study will showcase how HR is gradually shifting to the world of data-centric solutions and facilitating productivity and effectiveness of the firm. © 2024 by IGI Global. All rights reserved."
s,"Despite unprecedented technological advancement, people remain the most important resource for businesses to execute strategy. Yet, research reports that not all businesses ensure the optimum functioning of their people. This is evident from reports on (a) low levels of employee engagement, (b) deployed positions do not utilise peoples' 'competence', (c) leadership lacks information linking employees to strategy execution and resultant business performance, (d) measuring employees' contribution to business performance more readily at the tactical and operational levels than the strategic level of measurement, and (e) failure of strategy execution. Neglecting people is an enigma as leadership has long honed tools to make the most of their employees. One such tool is people analytics and another is strategy shaping. Consequently, we explored businesses use of people analytics in strategy execution, the vehicle ensuring business performance. This paper reports on the study. A literature review integrated strategy and people analytics culminating in a diagnostic which leadership can use to unlock human competence. An empirical study followed. Limited empirical evidence on the topic justified an exploratory survey which utilised an online questionnaire to collect vast amounts of standardised data from a purposively selected sample as best fit, which is uncommon. The data were descriptively analysed. The findings (a) showed that strategic level measurement is present at all levels of strategy shaping, and (b) overlooked at the business operational level where strategy is translated and executed, (c) revealed that these overlooked measurements are consequential for unlocking human competence, and (d) illustrated how people link to strategy execution. These findings provide preliminary evidence necessitating further descriptive and explanatory studies. This diagnostic provides requisite information enabling leadership to optimise the functioning of their employees by deploying suitably competent people in appropriate positions, rendering them available to perform, resulting in higher engagement levels, enhancing effective strategy execution, and improving business performance. This study contributes knowledge by demonstrating how people link to strategy execution, enabling leadership to make better decisions by discerning and selecting the critical people measures ensuring strategy execution and thus, business performance. © 2022 Authors.

s,"People analytics has brought a paradigm shift in the processes, technologies and systems of organizations. Success is driven here through data-driven methodologies. The primary objective of this research is to identify, rank and interrelate challenges affecting the adoption of people analytics in India. The interpretative structural modelling (ISM) approach is applied to rank and interrelate these challenges in the Indian context. MICMAC analysis is conducted to reveal the driving power and dependence of these challenges of people analytics. The MICMAC analysis also indicates the relative importance and interdependence between these challenges in the Indian context. During the first phase of the research, 12 challenges are identified from the literature, and these people analytics challenges are validated based on expert opinions. During the second phase, ISM identifies ‘Leveraging existing enterprise resources’ as the most important challenge in the Indian context among the 11 validated challenges. MICMAC analysis identifies all 11 challenges as ‘linkage challenges’ with high dependence and driving power. For researchers, this methodology facilitates further carrying out exploratory studies and focusing their interactions through hierarchical structures. The study investigates the core issue among many issues faced by people analytics professionals. Second, it has methodological novelty in the context. Finally, it points to multidimensional implications for various stakeholders in people analytics in the Indian context. © 2021 MDI."

s,"The paper explores opportunities and challenges for implementing human resourcing analytics (HRa) in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the first stages of their digital transformation. In the reference literature, this topic is not sufficiently represented, regardless of the importance that SMEs have in the economic system. The solutions presented and analyzed are primarily related to the digital transformation of large companies, which have much more resources at their disposal than SMEs, so these solutions are largely inapplicable to SMEs. For this purpose, an original model for the beginning of digital transformation was defined, which envisages the implementation of HR in SMEs (HRPA - HR People Analytic model). The main components of the model are presented and directions for implementation are indicated. The methodological procedure applied in the research is based on the literature review, the analysis of secondary sources and the results of the author’s previous research. Initial hypotheses were set, and recommendations were made for further development of the model. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

s,"Business leaders have access to a new set of tools to monitor and improve employees’ productivity and wellness as well as to retain talents: People or Human Resource Analytics. However, while People Analytics helps understanding employees at the individual level, it doesn’t reflect the social interactions happening in the workplace. For that, you would rather look at Organizational Network Analysis to examine how people communicate across an organization and give a more accurate and realistic understanding of employees’ interactions. In this paper, we propose a framework for organizations to supplement their People Analytics with Organizational Network Analysis. We address the different challenges associated to that and provide different case-studies based on real clients’ data to demonstrate how Organizational Network Analysis can be used to solve practical business applications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

s,"Purpose: Human resource analytics (HRA) has developed as a new business trend and challenge, stressing the strategic relevance of human resource management (HRM) to senior management executives. HRA is a process that uses statistical techniques, to link HR practices to organizational performance. The purpose of this study is to carry out recent development in HRA, bibliometric analysis and content analysis to present a comprehensive account of HRA to fill the gap in the evolution and status of its research. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on the recent advances in HRA in terms of it evolution and advancement by analyzing and drawing conclusions 480 articles retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database from 2003 to March 2022. The methodology is divided into four steps: data collection, analysis, visualization and interpretation. The study performed a rigorous bibliometric assessment of HRA using the bibliometric R-package and VOS viewer. Findings: The findings based on the literature survey, and bibliometric analysis, reveal the path-breaking articles, the prominent authors, most contributing institutions and countries that have contributed to the HRA scholarship. The results show that the number of publications has significantly increased from 2015 onwards, reaching a maximum of 101 journals in 2021. The USA, China, India, Canada and the United Kingdom were the most productive countries in terms of the total number of publications. Human Resource Management Journal, Human Resource Management, International Journal of Manpower, and Journal of Organizational Effectiveness-People and Performance are the top four academic outlets in the field of HRA. Additionally, the study identifies four clusters of HRA research and the knowledge gaps in HRA scholarship. Research limitations/implications: The present study is based on the articles retrieved from the WoS. The study underpins HRA research to understand the trends and presents a structured account. However, the study is not free from limitations. It is recommended that future research could be undertaken by combining WoS and Scopus databases to have a more detailed and comprehensive view. This study indicates that the field is still in its infancy stage. Hence, there is a need for more arduous research on the topic to help develop a better understanding of this field. Originality/value: The findings of knowledge clusters will drive future researchers to augment the field. The evolution of the four clusters and their subsequent development will fill the gaps in the literature.

s,"“Bossware” is software that monitors workers, tracking their activity and productivity in often hidden ways. This type of software has seen a surge of interest since the start of the pandemic, as managers attempt to retain oversight of workers in remote or distributed conditions. However, “bossware” is not monolithic but highly differentiated, with each product created by specific companies, with specific affordances, for specific purposes. This article thus builds a more articulated portrait of bossware by mapping the landscape. It first defines a schema based on the “expansiveness” and “invasiveness” of this software and maps key products along these two axes. It then develops a bossware typology ranging from spyware through to soft-bossware and productivity-ware, highlighting their differences in terms of data captured, userbases, perceived legitimacy, and existing safeguards. The article concludes by offering several approaches to investigating these technical regimes and stressing bossware as a site of both power and counterpower. © The author(s), 2024."
s,"Technologies such as people analytics software pose a potential threat towards the (information) privacy of employees and can reinforce existing social injustice. Therefore, it is crucial to design, develop, and deploy the systems with the well-being of employees in mind and to educate users about the harmful impact these tools can have on their personal and professional lives. Yet, the underlying assumptions of these tools are oftentimes hardly questioned. Especially in light of the ongoing public debate on remote work, with politicians discussing a new ‘right to work from home’, people analytics could become a key technology to facilitate more flexible work, and thereby shaping the future workplace. We establish a critical transformative perspective to outline and evaluate the potential benefits and risks of people analytics for remote workers. Subsequently, we provide a set of transformative actions for practice and IS research. © 2022 17th International Conference on Wirtschaftsinformatik, WI 2022. All rights reserved."
s,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore how positive organizational behaviors, specifically team proactivity, can be captured through digital data and what determines content validity of these data. The aim is to enable scientifically rigorous HR analytics projects for measuring and managing organizational behavior. Design/methodology/approach: Results are derived from interview data (N = 24) with team members, HR professionals and consultants of HR software. Findings: Based on inductive qualitative content analysis, the authors clustered six data types generated/recorded by 13 different technological applications that were proposed to be informative of team proactivity. Four determinants of content validity were derived. Practical implications: The overview of technological applications and resulting data types can stimulate diverse HR analytics projects, which can contribute to organizational performance. The authors suggest ways to control for the threats to content validity in the design of HR analytics or research projects.

s,"Featured Application: This paper describes the application of an agent-based simulation to understanding and managing the impact of diversity and inclusion on organizations. Diversity and inclusion (D&I) is a topic of increasing relevance across virtually all sectors of our society, with the potential for a significant impact on corporations and more broadly on our economy and society. While people are typically the most valuable asset of every organization, human resources (HR) in general, and D&I in particular, are dominated by qualitative approaches. This paper introduces an agent-based simulation that can quantify the impact of certain aspects of D&I on corporate performance. The simulation provides a parsimonious and compelling explanation of the impact of hiring and promotion biases on the resulting corporate gender balance, accurately replicating real-world data about gender imbalances across multiple industry sectors. In addition, the paper shows that the simulation can be used to predict the likely impact of different D&I interventions. Specifically, once a company has become imbalanced, even removing all promotion biases is not sufficient to rectify the situation, and it can take decades to undo the imbalances initially created by these biases. These and other results demonstrate that agent-based simulation is a powerful approach for managing D&I in corporate settings and could become an invaluable tool for the strategic and tactical management of human resources. © 2023 by the authors."

s,"In recent years the use of remote or hybrid formats of work organization in enterprises has become the world’s tendency. The introduction of the severe quarantine limitations related to the pandemic of COVID-19 and the avalanche-type character of the digitalization of society activated the changes in the sphere of social-labor relations, where the interests of different groups of workers are asymmetric. Many researchers who studied these phenomena mark the presence of divergences in individual advantages concerning the different formats of a labor organization of employers and hired workers. The dynamic of changes predefines the necessity of further research, which is why this subject acquires greater relevance. Our research aims to substantiate the approaches to balancing the interests of different categories of workers regarding the labor organization formats by exposing disbalances in the conditions of full-scale war in Ukraine. For monitoring, diagnosis, and management of disbalances, we substantiate the use of Data Mining in People Analytics (PA), the necessity of their combination with the classic instruments of study of personnel behavior, the use of active (reactive) formats of study of persons’ opinions in the extreme terms of running a business. The research results correlate with and confirm the world's tendencies of introducing a hybrid model of labor organization. The novelty of the executed research consists of substantiating the approaches to balancing the interests of the employees regarding different labor organization formats in the conditions of full-scale war in Ukraine. The presented study expands the scope of knowledge in the field of PA, as it takes into account new circumstances that have not existed since the end of World War II. It supplements data on work organization formats obtained by researchers of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with new data obtained as a result of a survey of employees and managers of various organizations in Ukraine, where there is a full-scale war. The presented study is one of the first that emphasizes the features of PA during wartime and explains why in such conditions it is necessary to combine Data Mining techniques with classic tools for studying personnel behavior. The authors substantiate possible approaches to balancing the interests of different categories of employees. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
s,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the importance of the ethical investigation of the emerging practice of people analytics (PA) within human resource (HR) management through charting the development of PA before during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is designed as a short review of the current thinking in the ethics of PA, a practical journey through the progression of PA across the pandemic and a theoretical exploration of PA through three lenses: virtue ethics, critical social theory and actor network theory. Findings: The authors suggest that PA raises novel ethical issues in terms of personal impact, increased penetration into working and home lives and the punch delivered in terms of organisational and behavioural change. Research limitations/implications: This study provides a short review of three theoretical approaches to PA. Detailed research and reflection is required to develop and extend an ethics of PA. While engagement with the ethics of PA requires gaining an understanding of the discipline, ideas and jargon of HR management, it is essential that ethicists engage with PA as HR departments take on greater influence and adopt executive roles. Practical implications: PA is now at the top of the HR management agenda, but there is limited understanding of the technology, the ethics and the new responsibilities it brings for HR management. This paper raises the profile of an ethical agenda, which practitioners should engage with. Social implications: The ethical consequences of PA have social implications as work practices change and hybrid working becomes prevalent. It has the potential to change the relationship between home and the workplace. Originality/value: This paper provides a unique synthesis of theory and practice in a new area of ethical importance. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
s,"In this paper we take stock of the current state of People Analytics and identify ways to increase business impact. We suggest a fourth wave of people analytics, which focuses on impact in MY company, not compared to someone else (benchmarking, reporting), not just mimicking someone else (best practice), and not being enamored with the research methodologies (predictive analytics). This pivots people analytics towards answering questions of value to your key stakeholders (employees, senior management and boards inside and investors, customers and communities outside the organization) instead of questions mostly relevant to HR professionals or regulators. We outline a guidance framework for how people analytics can help shape practical solutions for your company to outperform in areas relevant for you. We argue a focus on guidance will amplify the business impact of people analytics, making it more relevant for management actions. © The Author(s) 2023."
s,"Data related to various human movements are available due to the recent development of IoT devices and communication networks, and research on the use of historical data of human movements is being actively performed. In this study, we use log data on employee movement obtained from an entry/exit management system, which has been implemented in many businesses. We propose a method for creating a social network based on employee entry/exit history and observing employee performance. We focus on meeting room-related data from entry/exit data and evaluate employees using meeting network centrality indexes. According to the experimental results, the meeting network's closeness centrality best represents job position, while the meeting network's betweenness centrality best represents employee performance.  © 2023 IEEE."
s,"People Analytics (PA) software is increasingly used by companies to gain more insights into their data and to enhance their decision-making processes. Many companies rely on external software provided by PA vendors to support processes, such as screening of job applications or assessing employee’s performance. Using this software can impose multiple ethical risks. As there is only limited research about how fairness is constructed by PA vendors in practice, the aim of this research is to investigate the construction of fairness by PA vendors and to understand which phases of the employment life cycle are impacted by fairness. To do so, we analysed 21 websites of PA vendors. We identified seven different concepts of fairness. Furthermore, we were able to identify the phases that are most and least impacted by fairness in practice. Thus, our findings reveal that fairness is rather understood as a “thing” than a process or a particular outcome of a decision. This is important to understand, as it makes a difference in how fairness is theoretically constructed and how it is actually constructed in practice, which provides us a more differentiated understanding of fairness in the employment life cycle.

s,"Data application in organizations has shifted its focus to meeting the legal requirements of employment. This shift in data use gradually altered the dynamics of the Human Resource Management (HRM) role, and organizations now expect high-quality analysis from HR professionals. Various studies suggested that the use of Human Resource Analytics (HRA) would assist HR professionals in developing diverse viewpoints on their contribution to the financial targets of organizations through the creation of suitable measurements. Still, not many researchers have explored the role of HRA in increasing the business outcomes of Indian organizations. In this study, we analysed the role of HRA competencies in determining business outcomes as well as examined the gap existing in the expected and existing competencies of HR analysts in Indian organizations. Our in-depth literature review prepared a conceptual framework based on Capability Motivation and Opportunity (CMO) model. A quantitative methodology was adopted to gather the data as it integrates the components of HRA competency and measures their impact on business outcomes. A structured questionnaire was designed and distributed to 230 HR professionals, including HRA users as well as HR managers who work in different organizations in the city of Bengaluru. The data were analysed using various statistical tools and SPSS software. Overall, our study provides a significant depiction of the role of HRA in determining business outcomes, as well as the gap between the competencies demonstrated by HR analysts and the competency levels expected of them. © Este es un artículo en acceso abierto"
s,"Existing scholarship offers a comprehensive understanding of the concept and purposes of human resource analytics (HRA). However, how HRA is carried out in practice in organisations is still under-researched. We examine the practice of HRA through a systematic review across three disciplines, namely, human resource management, business analytics and management information systems while using a process lens: the knowledge discovery process (KDD) model. A hundred and three high-end quality manuscripts were analysed. Our findings show that the scope of HRA is expanding both in the use of HR and business data and certain sophisticated statistical techniques. However, much needs to be done to uncover the measurable impact of HRA on HR and business outcomes. © 2023 European Academy of Management."
s,"Our research reveals the continued and evolving role of the human factor in decision making in digitalized retail supply chains. We compare managerial roles in a pre- and post-COVID era through conducting in-depth interviews of 25 executives spanning the retail supply chain ecosystem. We use grounded theory to develop four main contributions. First, we find that the involvement of managerial judgment is found to be progressively greater moving up the retail supply chain, away from the customer and the demand signal. Second, integration of analytics and judgment is now the primary method of decision making, and we identify elements needed for success. Third, we develop an essential framework for a successful integration process. Fourth, we isolate the necessary components of a successful process for analytics/artificial intelligence (AI) implementation. Our paper offers important insights into how analytics and AI are—and should be used—in judgment and decision making and opportunities for researchers to understand the changing role of the human factor in digitalized retail supply chains. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
s,"Purpose: This research studies the ethical perspective concerning internet of things (IoT) placement in People Analytics. To provide researchers and professionals with ethical framework for IoT (internet of things) in people analytics. .Also to identify associated risk and opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: Initially, the applicability of Chuck Huff’s original Personality, Integration of morality, Moral Ecology and skills Model (PRIMES) is studied from context of IoT in people analytics. Secondly consideration of ethical issues in addition to PRIMES model are proposed based on limited scope of PRIMES in IoT and people analytics. Findings: The original PRIMES Model can be utilized in initial stages as ethical guiding framework for individuals employed in personnel department but it lacks coverage of ethical issues from perspective of IoT in people analytics. To address the ethical dimensions from IoT in people analytics viewpoint, additional ethical issues are addressed. Research limitations: The novel ethical framework for IoT in people analytics required further authentication and validation along with empirical testing in continuously emerging IoT and people analytics ecosystem. Implications: Considering the paucity of ethical frameworks in emerging area of IoT in people analytics, this study provides the ethical model in the area of IoT in people analytics for the researchers and practitioners. This framework can further be tested and used practically and can also be considered for theoretical development. Originality/Value: There is apparent deficiency of ethical norms in area of IoT in people analytics, this study contributes to the area by providing extended PRIMES Model as a preliminary ethical framework for IoT in people analytics. © 2022, Ismail Saritas.

s,"Recently, education and teaching have been significantly impacted by information and communication technologies. New cohorts of students, COVID-19 pandemic and pressure in the labour market on the labour force to master the technology-related skills and competence serve as main drivers for universities to redesign the way of teaching. A radical transformation of education caused by technologies is related to several aspects, such as online teaching or using other technologies in both physical and online learning environments with the focus on student-centred learning. The existing literature suggests that educational innovation through technologies allows for the adoption of collaborative, inclusive and student-driven pedagogy. The paper aims at revealing educational innovation through information and communication technologies in one of the courses for master’s students, namely People Analytics. While disclosing the particular case of one course, the paper seeks to provide the argumentation (advantages and disadvantages) for choosing specific tools and how these tools are embedded. The use of tools such as Zoom, digital escape rooms, Mentimeter, and Padlet, is presented.

s,"Algorithms are increasingly used by human resource departments to evaluate employee performance. While the algorithms are perceived to be objective and neutral by removing human biases, they are often perceived to be less fair than human managers. This research proposes dignity as an important construct in explaining the discrepancy in perceived fairness and investigates remedial steps for improving dignity and fairness for algorithm-based employee evaluations. Three experiments’ results show that those evaluated by algorithms perceive lower levels of dignity, leading them to believe the process is less fair. In addition, we find that providing justifications for algorithm usage in employee evaluations improves perceived dignity. However, human-algorithm collaboration does not enhance perceived dignity. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
s,"Although research identifies analytical and storytelling skills as the two broad human capital inputs required to perform people analytics, further research is required to better understand how People Analysts that is, the enactors of people analytics, perceive the impact of these skills on their performance. Accordingly, this study draws on the human capital resource (HCR) and HCR complementarity frameworks to investigate the individual and collective impact of analytical and storytelling skills on People Analysts perceived job performance. A mixed-method sequential explanatory research design is adopted, finding mixed results. Consistent with existing research, results from Phase 1 find People Analysts perceive storytelling skills to be positively associated with their job performance. However, contrary to existing claims, the findings reveal that analytical skills are only perceived to be significant in influencing People Analysts job performance when combined with storytelling skills, supporting a complementarity HCR relationship. To further explain the findings from Phase 1, Phase 2 involved collecting data from 50 people analytics professionals via semi-structured interviews. Results from the thematic analysis reinforce the survey findings while also illustrating that People Analysts perceive the complementarity relationship between analytical and storytelling skills as important for improving job performance. Accordingly, we argue that debate in this area should be reframed to acknowledge the necessity of complementarities in building people analytics capabilities. © 2023 The Authors.

s,"The intersection of people, data and intelligent machines has a far-reaching impact on the productivity, efficiency and operations of a smart industry. Internet-of-things (IoT) offers a great potential for workplace gains using the “quantified self” and the computer vision strategies. Their goal is to focus on productivity, fitness, wellness, and improvement of the work environment. Recognizing and regulating human emotion is vital to people analytics as it plays an important role in workplace productivity. Within the smart industry setting, various non-invasive IoT devices can be used to recognize emotions and study the behavioral outcomes in various situations. This research puts forward a deep learning model for detection of human emotional state in real-time using multimodal data from the Emotional Internet-of-things (E-IoT). The proposed multimodal emotion recognition model, MEmoR makes use of two data modalities: visual and psychophysiological. The video signals are sampled to obtain image frames and a ResNet50 model pre-trained for face recognition is fine-tuned for emotion classification. Simultaneously, CNN is trained on the psychophysiological signals and the results of the two modality networks are combined using decision-level weighted fusion. The model is tested on the benchmark Bio Vid Emo DB multimodal dataset and compared to the state-of-the-art. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
s,"Purpose: This paper aims to respond to questions being raised about the challenges, risks and impacts of Human Resource Analytics (HRA). Based on a study of 40 companies, it discusses the implications of HRA for practitioners, praxis and practices in HRM and adds to this a concern with whether HRA is enhancing mutuality in employment relationships. Design/methodology/approach: Using an abductive approach, the authors analyzed data from semistructured interviews with an HRA leader or specialist in 40 large organizations. Findings: While wrestling with the challenge of data quality and integration, the practice of descriptive analytics is widely adopted in these companies and the majority can demonstrate improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of HR activities through predictive analytics. The analytical competence of HR specialists is an ongoing issue. While much more research is needed, the companies in the authors’ sample demonstrated some valuable examples of mutual gains from HRA. Practical implications: Education in HRA must not only help to raise quantitative competencies among HR specialists but should also help them to ask critical questions about the theoretical propositions and subjective data points being built into HRA. Boundary spanning is important to enable effective HRA and processes for employee voice to be improved. Arguably, the time has come for a more formalized data analytics' strategy in large organizations. Originality/value: This paper provides evidence on how HRA is being implemented in large companies, including how HRA leaders are managing its challenges and risks and the impacts it is having on business and employee outcomes. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
s,"Purpose: Enabled by increased (“big”) data stocks and advanced (“machine learning”) analyses, the concept of human resource analytics (HRA) is expected to systematically improve decisions in human resource management (HRM). Since so far empirical evidence on this is, however, lacking, the authors' study examines which combinations of data and analyses are employed and which combinations deliver on the promise of improved decision quality. Design/methodology/approach: Theoretically, the paper employs a neo-configurational approach for founding and conceptualizing HRA. Methodically, based on a sample of German organizations, two varieties (crisp set and multi-value) of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) are employed to identify combinations of data and analyses sufficient and necessary for HRA success. Findings: The authors' study identifies existing configurations of data and analyses in HRM and uncovers which of these configurations cause improved decision quality. By evidencing that and which combinations of data and analyses conjuncturally cause decision quality, the authors' study provides a first confirmation of HRA success. Research limitations/implications: Major limitations refer to the cross-sectional and national sample and the usage of subjective measures. Major implications are the suitability of neo-configurational approaches for future research on HRA, while deeper conceptualizing and researching both the characteristics and outcomes of HRA constitutes a core future task. Originality/value: The authors' paper employs an innovative theoretical-methodical approach to explain and analyze conditions that conjuncturally cause decision quality therewith offering much needed empirical evidence on HRA success. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
s,"People analytics (PA) is a field of HR that uses the techniques of artificial intelligence, social sciences, and innovation to extract insights from employee data for business decision-making. This is an area that has shown growing interest from organizations, industry, and academia in the last decade. PA trends before the COVID-19 pandemic were mostly around the need to extract business value from the amalgamation of user data provided and data privacy. The latter is the most pressing. After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, PA managers’ concerns focused on empathy and data privacy were intensified. Through a literature review and content analysis of interviews and case studies on the internet, this evolution in PA trends is proven and a review on this topic to date is done. © 2024 by Apple Academic Press, Inc."
s,"Purpose: According to the significant growth of literature and continued adoption of people analytics in practice, it has been promised that people analytics will inform evidence-based decision-making and improve business outcomes. However, existing people analytics literature remains underdeveloped in understanding whether and how such promises have been realized. Accordingly, this study aims to investigate the current reality of people analytics and uncover the debates and challenges that are emerging as a result of its adoption. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducts a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed articles focused on people analytics published in the Association of Business School (ABS) ranked journals between 2011 and 2021. Findings: The review illustrates and critically evaluates several emerging debates and issues faced by people analytics, including inconsistency among the concept and definition of people analytics, people analytics ownership, ethical and privacy concerns of using people analytics, missing evidence of people analytics impact and readiness to perform people analytics. Practical implications: This review presents a comprehensive research agenda demonstrating the need for collaboration between scholars and practitioners to successfully align the promise and the current reality of people analytics. Originality/value: This systematic review is distinct from existing reviews in three ways. First, this review synthesizes and critically evaluates the significant growth of peer-reviewed articles focused on people analytics published in ABS ranked journals between 2011 and 2021. Second, the study adopts a thematic analysis and coding process to identify the emerging themes in the existing people analytics literature, ensuring the comprehensiveness of the review. Third, this study focused and expanded upon the debates and issues evolving within the emerging field of people analytics and offers an updated agenda for the future of people analytics research. © 2021, Steven McCartney and Na Fu."
s,"Recruiters today are often using some kind of tool with data mining and profiling, as an initial screening for successful candidates. Their objective is often to become more objective and get away from human limitation, such as implicit biases versus underprivileged groups of people. In this explorative analysis there have been three potential problems identified, regarding the practice of using these predictive computer tools for hiring. First, that they might miss the best candidates, as the employed algorithms are tuned with limited and outdated data. Second, is the risk of directly or indirectly discriminate candidates, or, third, failure to give equal opportunities for all individuals. The problems are not new to us, and from this theoretical analysis and from other similar work; it seems that algorithms and predictive data mining tools have similar kinds of implicit biases as humans. Our human limitations, then, does not seem to be limited to us humans. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016."

The purpose of this paper is to unveil some of the hidden secrets of people analytics. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews the common characteristics of those companies who have already been successful with it in their operations to date. Findings: These 16 best practices cover the role of the CHRO and the employees as well as HR’s general position within a company. Practical implications: While not all of the 16 best practices need to be in place, incorporating a few of them will provide significant benefit to businesses and employees. Social implications: While several of the best practices laid out in this paper directly impact personnel policies, they also all empower HR managers to be a force for good through optimised people analytics.

s,"Industrial events and exhibitions play a powerful role in creating social relations amongst individuals and firms, enabling them to expand their social network so to acquire resources. However, often these events impose a spatial structure which impacts encounter opportunities. In this paper, we study the impact that the spatial configuration has on the formation of network relations. We designed, developed and deployed aWi-Fi analytics solution comprising of wearableWi-Fi badges and gateways in a large scale industrial exhibition event to study the spatio-temporal trajectories of the 2.5K+ attendees including two special groups: 34 investors and 27 entrepreneurs. Our results suggest that certain zones with designated functionalities play a key role in forming social ties across attendees and the different behavioural properties of investors and entrepreneurs can be explained through a spatial lens. Based on our findings we offer three concrete recommendations for future organisers of networking events."
s,"In today’s VUCA environment that is Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous, organizations have to adopt technology -based business operations. Furthermore, HR leaders also have no choice but to accommodate technology based innovative processes in functions like recruitment, benefits management and payroll. In this regard, one interesting area that is grabbing the attention of HR practitioners these days is the so-called “Internet of Things” (IoT). “The Internet of things (IoT) is the internet-based working of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as “connected devices” and “smart devices”), buildings and other items - embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data’. IoT devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc. are connected devices that can help in the management of the HR practices better. With this information can be easily stored, transferred or retrieved about the employees for taking critical decisions. At the same time, ‘smart’ devices which use their sensors to provide real-time information from the physical environment and support data analytics in efficient and fast decision making. Internet of Things that has been adopted by organizations worldwide can help in setting-up the ecosystem for the organization to connect, track and measure the effectiveness and efficiency of humans in the digital work environment. It will also enable employers to make appropriate HR decisions to generate organizational growth with the availability of easy and cost-effective employee data. As the businesses are moving towards a quantified workplace where the decisions are made on data analytics (specifically on people analytics in HRM), IoT Technology help to quantify employee work focusing on productivity, fitness, wellness and improving the work environment. Therefore, the HR professionals need to realize the application of these web-based technological devices and circuits also known as ‘IoT’. It is expected that in future ‘IoT’ is going to transform the human resource management of the digital workplace environment and digital business operations effectively. The chapter would investigate and develop upon the importance and adoption of IoT worldwide in global organizations to build the best practices that are in use. It would focus on future innovations that can be made to HR practices and employee management with the help of connected devices so that people analytics can result in more sustainable organizations. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."
s,"With the high mobility of talent, it becomes critical for the recruitment team to find the right talent from the right source in an efficient manner. The prevalence of Online Professional Networks (OPNs), such as LinkedIn, enables the new paradigm for talent recruitment and job search. However, the dynamic and complex nature of such talent information imposes significant challenges to identify prospective talent sources from large-scale professional networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to create a job transition network where vertices stand for organizations and a directed edge represents the talent flow between two organizations for a time period. By analyzing this job transition network, it is able to extract talent circles in a way such that every circle includes the organizations with similar talent exchange patterns. Then, the characteristics of these talent circles can be used for talent recruitment and job search. To this end, we develop a talent circle detection model and design the corresponding learning method by maximizing the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) of inferred probability for the edge existence based on edge weights. Then, the identified circles will be labeled by the representative organizations as well as keywords in job descriptions. Moreover, based on these identified circles, we develop a talent exchange prediction method for talent recommendation. Finally, we have performed extensive experiments on realworld data. The results show that, our method can achieve much higher modularity when comparing to the benchmark approaches, as well as high precision and recall for talent exchange prediction. © 2016 ACM."
s,"Data analytics inform many facets of our everyday life, from Netflix recommendations to the ads that pop up on our social media feeds. This same technology can make an enormous difference in human resource and talent management enabling individuals to market their skillsets and organizations to describe their job requirements down to a granular level of detail in the hopes that searches, optimization algorithms, and simple recommendation engines can guide them towards an optimal decision for talent management - the right person in the right job at the right time. While these analytic tools are important to optimizing decisions, it is not always evident where to apply them for the best possible effect. The Army advanced analytics in a way that allows them to forecast their ability to fill critical job requirements over time by forecasting new acquisitions, promotions, and losses at the aggregate level. However, that system falls far short of being able to match people to positions in an optimal manner and results in long lag times when it comes to meeting emerging requirements. A new data collection system identifying both unitrequired and individual-possessed knowledge, skills, and behaviors (KSBs) will enable the Army to make forecasts and fill positions much more rapidly (along with assigning the best person to the position) provided the data is available to decision makers at the right time to best support talent management decisions. This paper outlines the new structure of this complex human resource (HR) system from data collection to analytic tools along with showing how modeling this system illustrates an adaptive complex system based on data engineering.  © 2020 The Authors."
s,"The systematic application of analytical methods on human resources (HR)-related (big) data is referred to as HR analytics or people analytics. Typical problems in HR analytics include the estimation of churn rates, the identification of knowledge and skill in an organization, and the prediction of success on a job. HR analytics, as opposed to the simple use of key performance indicators, is a growing field of interest because of the rapid growth of volume, velocity, and variety of HR data, driven by the digitalization of work processes. Personnel files used to be in steel lockers in the past. They are now stored in company systems, along with data from hiring processes, employee satisfaction surveys, e-mails, and process data. With the growing prevalence of HR analytics, a discussion around its ethics needs to occur. The objective of this paper is to discuss the ethical implications of the application of sophisticated analytical methods to questions in HR management. This paper builds on previous literature in algorithmic fairness that focuses on technical options to identify, measure, and reduce discrimination in data analysis. This paper applies to HR analytics the ethical frameworks discussed in other fields including medicine, robotics, learning analytics, and coaching. © 1957-2012 IBM."

s,"Concern among the public and policymakers about current and future major staff shortages is increasing. Strengthening Human Resource (HR) practices and adopting HR technologies such as Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS), that can collect, store and report workforce data are often described as a potential solution to this problem. Indeed, examples from other industries show that HRIS can help to launch or manage, as well as provide ongoing insights concerning the whole career cycle of an employee. However, few of the existing studies that discuss technology or its impacts on the future of work have focused on health organizations, and those that do have not received sufficient attention in health literature. Furthermore, such contributions as there have been have either prioritized a particular type of technology or focused mainly on the effect of automation on health professionals' work. They have thus overlooked the full range of possible uses of these technologies and, specifically, have neglected the topic of HR for Health (HRH) management in health organizations. The primary aim of this paper is to address this lacuna, with specific reference to the existing categorization of HR technological disruptions. To conclude, health organizations and the health and HR professionals who work within them need to use HRIS responsibly, finding a balance between the drive for innovation, productivity and efficiency and respect for all potential legal, ethical and compliance issues, as well as taking account of the importance of HRH wellbeing and satisfaction. © 2019 The Author(s)."
s,"Jeremy Bentham’s panopticon prison project was based on three central assumptions: the omnipresence of the “watcher”; the universal visibility of objects of surveillance; and the assumption, by the “watched,” that they are under constant observation. While the metaphor of the panopticon, following Michel Foucault’s work, was often applied to workplace and workplace surveillance to highlight the “disciplining” power of the supervisor’s “gaze,” this paper argues that it is only with the recent advent of digital employee monitoring technology that the workplace is becoming truly “panoptic.” With modern electronic means of surveillance, the supervisor is always “looking”—even when not physically present or not actually watching employees—as all worker actions and movements may now be recorded and analyzed (in real time or at any time in the future). This paper argues that the modern workplace approximates Bentham’s panoptic prison much more than the “traditional” workplace ever did and examines the implications of this fundamental historical change in the paradigm of employee monitoring for power relations in the modern workplace. © The author(s), 2020."
s,"It is increasingly common for companies to use artificial intelligence mechanisms to manage work. This study examines the health hazards caused by these new forms of technological management. Occupational risks can be reduced if they are taken into account when programming an algorithm. This study confirms the need for algorithms to be correctly programmed, taking account of these occupational risks. In the same way as supervisors have to be trained in risk prevention to be able to perform their work, the algorithm must be programmed to weigh up the occupational risks – and when such features do not exist, steps must be taken to prevent the algorithm being used to direct workers. The algorithm must assess all (known) factors posing a risk to workers’ health and safety. It therefore seems necessary to incorporate a mandatory risk assessment performed by specialists in the programming of algorithms so that all ascertained risks can be taken into account. © The Author(s) 2021."
s,"The perceived fairness of decision-making procedures is a key concern for organizations, particularly when evaluating employees and determining personnel outcomes. Algorithms have created opportunities for increasing fairness by overcoming biases commonly displayed by human decision makers. However, while HR algorithms may remove human bias in decision making, we argue that those being evaluated may perceive the process as reductionistic, leading them to think that certain qualitative information or contextualization is not being taken into account. We argue that this can undermine their beliefs about the procedural fairness of using HR algorithms to evaluate performance by promoting the assumption that decisions made by algorithms are based on less accurate information than identical decisions made by humans. Results from four laboratory experiments (N = 798) and a large-scale randomized experiment in an organizational setting (N = 1654) confirm this hypothesis. Theoretical and practical implications for organizations using algorithms and data analytics are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

The most competitive sector in hospitality is the hotel sector, and it focusses mainly on quality customer services and in delivering guests needs and wants. However, there is growing concern in the tourism industry in general about current and future major staff shortages increasing. Focusing on human resource (HR), especially the Human Resource Information System (HRIS), which can record and report the employees' data is the prospective solution to this problem in Iraq. HRIS systems must be used to collect, to record and store, to examine and recover, all the data related to an organization's human resource activities. A few of the recent researches that discussed HRIS technology and its impacts on hotel organizations, show that it is indeed growing and developing. By using an information system an HR manager can reduce the cost of administrative work, grow productivity, and importantly shorten the response time so as to improve decision-making, the quality of the customer service offered to guests. Furthermore, such studies emphasized certain types of information technology and information systems have become very important for most organizations if not all. The aim of this paper is to address the need to use HRIS in hotel performance in Iraq and specally the importance of HRIS for customers' and their ultimate wellbeing and satisfaction.

In Zuboff ’s lengthy book The age of surveillance capitalism, we learn about the strategic and often underhand means by which these data are captured, and the ‘instrumentarian’ ideology that provides the logic for this enterprise. Zuboff shows that the aim of advertisers and ‘people analytics’ advocates is to use our personal data to determine our behavior. At stake is free will and our ‘right to the future tense’. In this book review, I reflect on Zuboff ’s analysis of how Big Tech, as Big Other, is controlling our lives. I first highlight the prescience of the book’s arguments. I then compare aspects of the book with earlier tomes that were critical of new technology, to argue that taking a deterministic view of peoples’ relationship with technology may inadvertently support the hyped narrative that data analytics and algorithms are all-powerful. © 2021 Ella Hafermalz"

This study aims to systematically identify the key KSAOs and develop a competency model for HR Analysts amid the growing digitalization of work. Design/methodology/approach: Adopting best practices for competency modeling set out by Campion et al. (2011), this study first analyzes 110 HR analyst job advertisements collected from five countries: Australia, Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the USA. Second a thematic analysis of 12 in-depth semistructured interviews with HR analytics professionals from Canada and Ireland is then conducted to develop a novel competency model for HR Analysts. Findings: This study adds to the developing and fast-growing field of HR analytics literature by offering evidence supporting a set of six distinct competencies required by HR Analysts including: consulting, technical knowledge, data fluency and data analysis, HR and business acumen, research and discovery and storytelling and communication. Practical implications: The research findings have several practical implications, specifically in recruitment and selection, HR development and HR system alignment.

s,"Talent flow analysis is a process for analyzing and modeling the flows of employees into and out of targeted organizations, regions, or industries. A clear understanding of talent flows is critical for many applications, such as human resource planning, brain drain monitoring, and future workforce forecasting. However, existing studies on talent flow analysis are either qualitative or limited by coarse level quantitative modeling. To this end, in this paper, we provide a fine-grained data-driven approach to model the dynamics and evolving nature of talent flows by leveraging the rich information available in job transition networks. Specifically, we first investigate how to enrich the sparse talent flow data by exploiting the correlations between the stock price movement and the talent flows of public companies. Then, we formalize the talent flow modeling problem as to predict the increments of the edge weights in the dynamic job transition network. In this way, the problem is transformed into a multi-step time series forecasting problem. A deep sequence prediction model is developed based on the recurrent neural network model, which consumes multiple input sources derived from dynamic job transition networks. Finally, experimental results on real-world data show that the proposed model outperforms other benchmark models in terms of prediction accuracy. The results also indicate that the proposed model can provide reasonable performance even if the historical talent flow data are not completely available. © 1989-2012 IEEE."
s,"Purpose: Despite the growth and adoption of human resource (HR) analytics, it remains unknown whether HR analytics can impact organizational performance. As such, this study aims to address this important issue by understanding why, how and when HR analytics leads to increased organizational performance and uncover the mechanisms through which this increased performance occurs. Design/methodology/approach: Using data collected from 155 Irish organizations, structural equation modeling was performed to test the chain mediation model linking HR technology, HR analytics, evidence-based management (EBM) and organizational performance. Findings: The study's findings support the proposed chain model, suggesting that access to HR technology enables HR analytics which facilitates EBM, which in turn enhances organizational performance. Originality/value: This research contributes significantly to the HR analytics and EBM literature. First, the study extends our understanding of why and how HR analytics leads to higher organizational performance. Second, the authors identify that access to HR technology enables and is an antecedent of HR analytics.

The originality of this paper consists in proposing an architecture to work within the process of obtaining semantically enriched data by using data science and Semantic Web technologies. We applied the proposed architecture and developed a case study-based prototype that uses analytics techniques for résumé data integrated with Linked Data technologies. We conducted a case study to identify skills by applying classification via regression, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), random forest, naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and decision tree algorithms to résumé data that we previously described with terms from publicly available ontologies. We labeled data from résumés using terms from existing human resource ontologies.

s,"Traditionally being considered to have little data affinity, HR departments are coming under increasing pressure to demonstrate the effectiveness of their activities. Against this background, HR managers show a growing interest in „workforce“or „people analytics“, which are celebrated in management literature and by consulting and software development companies as revolutionary tools of a data- driven and evidence-based management. By means of an algorithm-based analysis of the relation-ships between the work behaviour/skills of employees, HRM/leadership practice and company-relatedperformance variables, not only the quality of management decisions, but also the exploitation of employee potential is to be significantly increased.

s,"Given a corpus of employee peer reviews from a large corporation where each review is structured into pros and cons, what are the prevalent traits that employees talk about? How can we describe the performance of an employee with just a few sentences, that help us interpret what their work is praised and criticized for? What is the best way to summarize an employee's reviews, while preserving the content and sentiment as well as possible? In this work, we study a large collection of corporation-wide employee peer reviews from a technology enterprise. Motivated by the challenges we outline in our analysis of employee review data, our work makes two main contributions in the domain of people analytics: (a) Sentiment-Aspect Model (SAM): we introduce a stylized log-linear model that identifies the hidden aspects and sentiment within an employee peer review corpus, (b) Interpretable Sentiment-Aspect Representations (EMPLOYEE2VEC): Using SAM, we produce a vector space embedding for each employee, containing an overall sentiment score per aspect, and (c) Summarization of Employee Peer Reviews (PEERSUM): we summarize an employee's peer reviews with just a few sentences which reflect the most prevalent traits and associated sentiment for the employee as much as possible. We show that our model SAM can use the structure present in the dataset as supervision to discover meaningful latent traits and sentiment embodied in the reviews. Our employee vector representations Employee2vecprovide a compact, interpretable overview of their evaluation. The review summaries extracted by PeersUmprovide text that explains the professional performance of an employee in a succinct and objectively quantifiable way.

s,"The organizations are evolving through technological advancements and building a novel tech- culture by implementing the People Analytics, Machine Learning, IOT and Artificial Intelligence. The digitalization of both structured and unstructured data has helped organizations to predict future events across all the functional areas, mainly - Marketing, Operations, Finance, Productions, and Human resource management. People analytics is leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) for improving business decisions related to acquisition, motivation, utilization, and retention of talented employees in the organizations. This paper attempts to study how organizations are leveraging technology and tools to radically transform the way HR and business leaders are using people data. In this paper, we have discussed a framework for real-time data analysis with the help of wearable IoT devices. We have considered wearable IOT technology supported wristband which will be enabled with movement sensors, GPS, accelerometer, heart rate related sensor, thermometer sensor for real time data collection. These sensors continuously collect data and can send to the nearby designed system as per the communication network. This data can give much-hidden insight about an employee. The paper suggests a model for the Human Resource Management system through wearable IoT device to provide unbiased and transparent results. © 2019 IEEE."
s,"This book directly addresses the explosion of literature about leveraging analytics with employee data and how organizational psychologists and practitioners can harness new information to help guide positive change in the workplace. In order for today's organizational psychologists to successfully work with their partners they must go beyond behavioral science into the realms of computing and business acumen. Similarly, today's data scientists must appreciate the unique aspects of behavioral data and the special circumstances which surround HR data and HR systems. Finally, traditional HR professionals must become familiar with research methods, statistics, and data systems in order to collaborate with these new specialized partners and teams. Despite the increasing importance of this diversity of skill, many organizations are still unprepared to build teams with the comprehensive skills necessary to have high performing HR Analytics functions. And importantly, all these considerations are magnified by the introduction and acceleration of machine learning in HR. This book will serve as an introduction to these areas and provide guidance on building the connectivity across domains required to establish well-rounded skills for individuals and best practices for organizations when beginning to apply advanced analytics to workforce data. It will also introduce machine learning and where it fits within the larger HR Analytics framework by explaining many of its basic tenets and methodologies. By the end of the book, readers will understand the skills required to do advanced HR analytics well, as well as how to begin designing and applying machine learning within a larger human capital strategy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

s,"The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic promoted the development of Industry 4.0 leading to the fifth industrial revolution (Industry 5.0). It brought in new ways of working and the role of the office in the future. It redesigned the workplace to support organizational priorities and resize the footprint creatively. Digitalization and globalization have sparked radical shifts in how employees live and work. In an age of digital disruption, companies and HR leaders are forced to revise organizational on how they organize, recruit, develop, manage and engage the 21st-century workforce. The big questions are: how can HR help business leaders reconstruct the workforce of the future? What effort has the company take to change future work and their workforce today so that it looks different 15 years later? Organizational agility, careers and learning disruption, talent disruption, rethinking performance management and people analytics in addition to creating the right structure, analysis, and standardized people metrics are the key to success and critical drivers to design talent strategy. This study aims to identify the magic ingredient (or strategies) behind managing an organization's talent in creating business success. We further examined and mathematically modelled these strategies in attracting and retaining high-quality employees, developing their skills, and continuously motivating them to improve their performance in the age of distraction and disruption. 354 employees from IT companies participated in the survey. The findings of the study show, as expected, that a compelling employer brand is the most effective talent management strategy of all when it combines three key drivers: organizational culture, organization goodwill and competition for talent.

s,"Software repositories and Question & Answer sites constitute promising and ever-increasing sources of information for software analytics and for the identification of the role of the human factor in software engineering. Empirical evidence suggests that studying the human factor in software-related issues is multifaceted. Although analyses on different levels of developer networks have been performed, there is no existing work that moves beyond developer technical skills to take into account other important factors that might affect development work, such as personality and non-technical skills. For this reason, in this work we propose an approach that aims at finding links between badges - a sort of gamification awarded for developer's participation - personality traits, and interpersonal skills from Stack Overflow developers' community. The Generalized Linear Models (GLM) approach is adopted in order to examine the effects of personality traits and interpersonal skills on the non-technical awarded badges. Experimental results from the application of the proposed framework revealed statistically significant effects of both personality traits and interpersonal skills on the award gamification process. © 2018 IEEE."
s,"It is essential use descriptive, visual, and statistical methods to interpret human resource data and processes. This study aims to increase the efficacy in calculating the data analysis of employees through the training of talent mapping to the students of psychology. This study used the design of a non-equivalent control group with pretest and posttest design. The measurement tool was the people analytics-efficacy scale adapted from the combination of Bandura’s self-efficacy scale and the concept of people analytics. The result of this study concluded that talent mapping training was able to increase the confidence of psychology students. It means that high people analytics-efficacy do not only perceive themselves to be able to complete talent mapping operations on a larger or more difficult scale but also show higher confidence in their ability to successfully perform existing talent mapping operations. © 2020 IEEE."
s,"The sustainable computer-based evaluation system (SCE) is a scenario-based formative evaluation system, in which students are assigned a task during a course. The tasks include the diversity conditions in real-world scenarios. The goals of this system are learning to think as a professional in a certain discipline. While the substantive, psychological, instructional, and task developmental aspects of the assessment have been investigated, few analytic methods have been proposed that allow us to provide feedback to learners in a formative way. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a framework of a learning analytic method including (1) an assessment design through evidence-centered design (ECD), (2) a data mining method using social network analysis, and (3) an analytic method using a Bayesian network. This analytic framework can analyze the learners' performances based on a computational psychometric framework. The tasks were designed to measure 21st century learning skills. The 250 samples of data collected from the system were analyzed. The results from the social network analysis provide the learning path during a course. In addition, the 21st century learning skills of each learner were inferred from the Bayesian network over multiple time points. Therefore, the learning analytics proposed in this study can offer the student learning progression as well as effective feedback for learning. © 2020 by the authors."
s,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the key ingredients that people analytics teams require to contribute to organizational performance. As the information that is currently available is fragmented, it is difficult for organizations to understand what it takes to execute people analytics successfully. Design/methodology/approach: To identify the key ingredients, a narrative literature review was conducted using both traditional people analytics and broader business intelligence literature. The findings were summarized in the People Analytics Effectiveness Wheel. Findings: The People Analytics Effectiveness Wheel identifies four categories of ingredients that a people analytics team requires to be effective. These are enabling resources, products, stakeholder management and governance structure. Under each category, multiple sub-themes are discussed, such as data and infrastructure; senior management support; and knowledge, skills, abilities and other characteristics (KSAOs) (enablers). Practical implications: Many organizations are still trying to set up their people analytics teams, and many others are struggling to improve decision-making by using people analytics. For these companies, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current literature and describes what it takes to contribute to organizational performance using people analytics. Originality/value: This paper is designed to provide organizations and researchers with a comprehensive understanding of what it takes to execute people analytics successfully. By using the People Analytics Effectiveness Wheel as a guideline, scholars are now better equipped to research the processes that are required for the ingredients to be truly effective. © 2020, Tina Peeters, Jaap Paauwe and Karina Van De Voorde."
s,"As working from home became mandatory during the COVID-19 lockdown, many businesses feared negative productivity shifts originating from the new way of working based on the same processes and technology. Process Mining as a data-driven process discovery, analysis and monitoring method offers the continuous monitoring of process performance. In practice, however, severe limitations arise when assessing the time effort required for process execution as many enterprise resource planning systems do not record the time required for the execution of activities. In this context, the contributions of this paper are twofold: first, we present Effort Mining as a process- and system-agnostic method that allows us to estimate the time required for process steps; second, we apply this method to compare the effort before and during the lockdown as a means to identify productivity gaps induced by the pandemic. Our investigation has identified no substantial change in the employees' productivity, indicating that the underlying business processes and corresponding technology were fit for purpose in both scenarios.

s,"Advertisement (hereby referred as 'ad') blockers are a continuous emerging threat to Digital Content Writers. While most of the creators prefer to keep the content free by allowing ads, these Ad blockers are causing harm. They are useful to block spam ads but without any means of segregation between good or bad, it is prone to block 'Advertisements'. This paper focuses on how the Business analysis could be employed to construct a strategy that companies that display written content like e-newspapers & e-magazines could employ to deal with the threat posed by Advertisement blocking software. The problem statement is explained in four phases of Business Analytics: Operations Analytics studied the models that predict the effect of the Ad-blockers on the organization; Customer Analytics guided the research by predicting the customer behaviour, marketing decisions, and Strategy. Accounting Analytics dealt with how the Ad-blockers affect the company's financial bottom line. Finally, People Analytics suggested the measures that strengthen the company's internal organization to deal with Ad-blockers. The main strategy to tackle this issue was taken from Wharton's Future of Advertising (WFoA) program's R.A.V.E.S.[1] that is an advertisement must be relevant and respectful, actionable, valuable and value generating with exceptional experience and share-worthy story from the end user. Alternative strategies like Enhancing the User Experience in the mobile application, collaborating and sharing knowledge articles with similar companies was also discussed. The anticipated effects of the proposed strategy were measured through various metrics that included customer satisfaction levels through paid apps, subscription fees, pay-per-click thoughts. Key drivers to the customer's chance of viewing the advertisement were discussed along with questions for measurement were answered thereby giving the entire Business Analytics Model implementation. © 2017 IEEE."

s,"This mixed-method ‘scoping review’ mapped the emergence of the term People Analytics (PA), the value propositions offered by vendors of PA tools and services and the PA skillsets being sought by professionals. Analysis of academic research and online search traffic since 2002 revealed changes in the relative trajectory of PA and conceptually related terms over the past fifteen years, indicating both the re-branding of similar innovations and a differentiation of priorities and communities of practice. The market in commercial PA tools and services is diverse, offering numerous functional and strategic benefits, although published evidence of these outcomes remains sparse. Companies marketing PA systems and services emphasise benefits to employers more than to personnel. Across the sources examined, including specialised online courses, PA was largely aligned with HRM, however its development reflects the shifting focus of HR departments from supporting functional to strategic organisational requirements. Consideration of ethical issues was largely absent. © 2018 The Authors"

s,"Skills and competences of people participating in online professional networks constitute an ever-increasing new source for data collection and analysis. An important sub-domain of human resources management (HRM) is the recruitment process. Job advertisements and people profiles are main parts of recruitment and since are now available online, they constitute a key factor of a new e-recruitment era. Data mining for erecruitment analysis is important in order to extract a knowledge base for people analytics. Skills and competences are the key variables for people analytics and can be drawn from job advertisements. Leveraging the raw information of online job offers, provides a rich source for people analytics. Detecting the appropriate skills and competences for a job from raw text data and associate them with a job seeker is an increasing challenge. The main objective of this paper is the proposal of a framework aiming to collect online job advertisements from a web source which concerns IT job offers and to extract from the raw text the required skills and competences for specific jobs. The selected professional networking web source is StackOverflow and multivariate statistical data analysis was used to test the correlations between skills and competences in the job offers dataset. The present work falls in a relatively new field of research, concerning the competence mining of peopleware data with special focus on software development. © 2017 IEEE."

s,"Technology is changing the way in which workers are controlled. From video cameras to GPS, these technologies allow for constant monitoring of workers' activities; however, recently two new forms of control have emerged. One consisting in giving customers a controlling role over workers' performance and another, the ""big data"" (algorithms and artificial intelligence) which allow employers to process information about their employees in a far more efficient manner and at a much lower cost than has been the case until now. This makes it possible to profile workers automatically and even allows technology itself to replace human resources supervisors and managers and to make decisions that have legal effects on the employees (recruitment, promotion, dismissals, etc.). This entails great risks of discrimination by the technology in command, as well as the defenselessness of the worker, who is unaware of the reasons underlying such a decision and specific health and occupational risks for workers. This study analyzes the risks that these new technologies are posing to workers and what challenges labor law is facing. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

s,"Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) has led to rapidly changing the business environment. Integration of AI in human resource will facilitate the analysing, predicting and diagnosing of the issues faced by the organizations and help to make better employee related decisions. An integrative synthesis of multiple streams of literature was undertaken to critically analyze the implementation of AI and HR analytics in HRM for performance enhancement and to gain a competitive advantage. The HRM has undergone a drastic transformation from the administrative functionality to more advanced processes like automation through application of artificial intelligence which has entirely re-defined and re-shaped the attributes of the organizational workforce. AI plays a major role within HR to support smart people analytics. With deployment of AI and analytics in HR functions such as talent acquisition, training and development, employee retention, employee engagement and performance appraisal, organizations can enhance proficiency and productivity. Additionally, AI, cloud and HR Analytics also support in collecting huge volumes of employee information. HR is considered as a 'predictive engine' essential for the organizational upliftment. The real challenge for HR department is how thoroughly they can enhance employee skills and re-renovate their teams in the field of HR Analytics and AI. The current research evaluates the functional analysis of artificial intelligence in the human resource context.

s,"As Millennials, and next in line the iGen, begin to take over the workforce, they are bringing with them leadership trends that will shape the future of organizational leadership. Modern organizations must respond to an increased pace of the workplace, and the nature of executives’ tasks is increasingly complex. Despite the evidence suggesting that focusing on growth versus performance will lead to better long-term performance, our business schools continue to emphasize managing performance instead of leading growth. Trends such as real-time feedback, agile networks of teams, advanced people analytics, micro-learning, personalized learning, and artificial intelligence enable the digitally minded leader to shape the future of leadership. We know that many leadership dimensions have a causal relationship with desirable organizational outcomes, and that the foundational pillars of leadership, such as shared values and vision, talent development, change management, and reward and recognition, will likely continue to drive these outcomes.

s,"One of the challenges faced by Talent Acquisition teams today pertains to the acquisition of human resources by matching job descriptions and skillsets desired. It is more so in the case of competitive sectors like the Indian IT sector. There can be various channels for Talent Acquisition and accordingly, the cost and benefits might vary. However, the consequences of a mismatch have an impact on the quality of deliverables, high recruitment expenses and loss of revenue for the organization. With increased and diverse sources of data that are available to organizations today, there is ample opportunity to apply analytics for informed decision making in this field. This paper reveals useful insights that help streamline the Talent Acquisition process in the Indian IT Industry. The paper adopts a data-centric approach to examine the critical determinants for efficient and effective Talent Acquisition process in IT organizations. Selected supervised machine learning algorithms are applied for the analysis of the dataset.

s,"Frequently humans are invited to engage with modern visual forms: emoji, emoticons, pictograms. Some of these forms are finding their way into the workplace, understood as augmentations to workplace atmospheres. What has been called the ‘quantified workplace’ requires its workers to log their rates of stress, wellbeing and subjective sense of productivity on a scale of 1–5 or by emoji, in a context in which Human Resources (HR) professionals develop a vocabulary of Workforce Analytics, People Analytics, Human Capital Analytics or Talent Analytics, and all this in the context of managing the work environment or its atmosphere. Atmosphere is mood, a compote of emotions. Emotions are a part of a human package characterized as ‘the quantified self’, a self intertwined with – subject to but also compliant with – tracking and archiving. The logical step for managing atmospheres is to track emotions at a granular and large-scale level. Through the concept of the digital crowd, rated and self-rating, as well as emotion-tracking strategies, the human resource (as worker and consumer) engages in a new politics of the crowd, organized around what political philosopher Jodi Dean calls, affirmatively, ‘secondary visuality’, high-circulation communication fusing speech, writing and image as a new form. This is the visuality of communicative, or social media, capitalism. But to the extent that it is captured by HR, is it an exposure less to crowd-sourced democracy, and more a stage in turning the employee into an on-the-shelf item in a digital economy warehouse, assessed by Likert scales? While HR works on new atmospheres of work, what other atmospheres pervade the context of labour, and can these be deployed in the generation of other types of affect, ones that work towards the free association of labour and life? © The Author(s), 2019."
s,"Machine Learning (ML) based assessment of soft skills is a challenging domain in social computing. In today's enterprises, soft skills are regarded as one of the most crucial components for success. Based on data obtained from internal organizational sources, we evaluated the viability of utilizing ML to assess Group Communication Analysis (GSA) skills. We leveraged Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to understand and learn cognitive phenomena extracted from the communication extracted from the issue tracker of several popular open-source projects, with a specific input representation that allows the model to look for contextual cues in consecutive utterances. We looked at the data of 1520 engineers from three open-source software development projects that worked on an internal line of business operational systems. The ML models revealed five interpersonal and intrapersonal socio-cognitive GSA metrics in 10583 utterances and procedures, which were integrated into five clusters that assign socially engaged employee roles. Because there has not been any research on assessing employees' Soft Skills utilizing ML, our proposed method is a first in this field, relying on internal organizational datasets to obtain reliable Soft Skills assessment evaluation.  © 2021 IEEE."

To better understand people analytics and the role of information technology, we perform a thorough evaluation of the available software tools. We monitored social media to identify and analyze 41 people analytics tools. Afterward, we sort these tools by employing a coding scheme focused on five dimensions: methods, stakeholders, outcomes, data sources, and ethical issues. Based on these dimensions, we classify the tools into five archetypes, namely employee surveillance, technical platforms, social network analytics, human resources analytics, and technical monitoring.

s,"Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to the literature on human resources (HR) digitalization, specifically on HR analytics, disentangling the concept of analytics applied to HR and explaining the factors that hinder companies from moving to analytics. Therefore, the central research questions addressed in this study are: what does HR analytics encompass? What impedes the adoption of analytics in HR within organizations? Design/methodology/approach: The authors performed a comprehensive literature review on analytics as applied in HR. The authors relied on two of the major multidisciplinary publication databases (i.e. Scopus and WoS). A total of 64 manuscripts from 2010 to 2019 were content analyzed. Findings: The results reveal that there is an ongoing confusion on HR analytics conceptualization. Yet, it seems that there is an emerging consensus on what HR analytics encompasses. The authors have identified 14 different barriers for HR analytics adoption grouped into four categories, namely, data and models, software and technology, people and management. Grounding on them the authors propose a set of 14 key factors to help to successfully adopt HR Analytics in companies. Originality/value: This paper brings clarity over the conceptualization of HR analytics by offering a comprehensive definition. Additionally, it facilitates business and HR leaders in making informed decisions on adopting and implementing HR analytics. Moreover, it assists HR researchers in positioning their paper more explicitly in current debates and encouraging them to develop some future avenues of research departing from some questions posed. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."
s,"Last few years have seen an overwhelming increase in the application of People Analytics, as an HR practice globally. Organizations have formed specialized teams and software companies, are designing newest predictive systems to help HR with data extraction and understanding People Analytics. However, there are still a number of limitations reported in numerous studies, such as: data privacy and perception limitations hindering effective convergence of People Analytics into HR practices. This study holistically approaches the topic by critically reviewing and synthesizing the existing literature; by comparing region-wise business performance indicators to understand the role of People Analytics, performs content analysis on selected reports to identify perception level limitations of People Analytics, and finally generates correlated qualitative themes to address convergence limitations of People Analytics into HR practices. The study provides a Two-Tier solution validated through Content Analysis performed in the Nvivo. Data analysis shows emergence of two broad correlated themes-1) limitations at functional level and 2) limitations at normative (psychological) level.

By using HR big data, HRA impacts multiple organizational levels, from individual employees to HR functions and the organizational strategy. Practical implications: While research on data analytics has recently flourished across various management fields, this has not been the case for the broader field of HR. This is especially a growing concern as the lack of understanding of the basics and fundamentals of people analytics in the field of HR may delay the effective implementation and operationalization of HRA and present additional barriers impacting on-going HR activities, as well as HR’s role as a strategic business partner. HR practice may greatly benefit from gaining an understanding of HRA and the multi-levels of impact it may have on the organization. Originality/value: This paper explores various concepts related to HRA by examining terms such as “HR metrics” vs “HR” and “HR big data” vs “big data.” Furthermore, the comprehensive HRA operational framework presented in this paper provides HR professionals and researchers with a better understanding of HRA in the age of data analytics and artificial intelligence. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

s,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the use of bibliometric indicators as a people analytics tool for examining research performance outcome differences in faculty mobility and turnover. Design/methodology/approach: Employing bibliometric information from research databases, the publication, citations, h-index and newly developed individual annualized h-index (hIa-index) for a sample of university faculty is examined (N = 684). Information relating to turnover decisions from a human resource (HR) information system and bibliometric data from a research database are combined to explore research performance differences across cohorts of retained, resigned or terminated faculty over a five-year period in a single university. Findings: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results indicate traditional bibliometric indicators of h-index, publication count and citation count which are limited in their ability to identify performance differences between employment status cohorts. Results do show some promise for the newly developed hIa-index, as it is found to be significantly lower for terminated faculty (p < 0.001), as compared to both retained and resigned faculty. Multinomial logistic regression analysis also confirms the hIa metric as a predictor of terminated employment status. Research limitations/implications: First, the results imply that the hIa-index, which controls for career length and elements of coauthorship is a superior bibliometric indicator for comparison of research performance. Practical implications: Results suggest that the hIa metric may serve as a useful tool for the examination of employment decisions for universities. It also highlights the potential usefulness of bibliometric indicators for people analytics and the examination of employment decisions, performance management and faculty turnover in research-intensive higher education contexts. Originality/value: This empirical paper is entirely unique. No research has previously examined the issue of turnover in a university setting using the bibliometric measures employed here. This is a first example of the potential use of hIa bibliometric index as an HR analytics tool for the examination of HR decisions such as employee turnover in the university context. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."
s,"This paper aims at filling some gaps in the mainstream debate on automation and the future of work. This debate has concentrated, so far, on how many jobs will be lost as a consequence of technological innovation. This paper examines instead issues related to the quality of jobs in future labour markets. It addresses the detrimental effects on workers of awarding legal capacity and rights and obligation to robots. It examines the implications of practices such as People Analytics and the use of big data and artificial intelligence to manage the workforce. It stresses on an oft-neglected feature of the contract of employment, namely the fact that it vests the employer with authority and managerial prerogatives over workers. It points out that a vital function of labour law is to limit these authority and prerogatives to protect the human dignity of workers. It then highlights the benefits of human-rights based approaches to labour regulation to protect workers’ privacy against invasive electronic monitoring. It concludes by highlighting the crucial role of collective regulation and social partners in governing automation and the impact of technology at the workplace. It stresses that collective dismissal regulation and the involvement of workers’ representatives in managing and preventing job losses is crucial and that collective actors should actively participate in the governance of technology-enhanced management systems, to ensure a vital “human-in-command” approach. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
s,"Human resource management deals with issues related to the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization by strategically focusing upon the optimum utilization of the employees which shall result in profits not only for the organization but for its employees as well. Workforce analytics combines, the need for analyzing the human resource aptly and an adequate software that can provide us with sufficient insights to make fruitful decisions. Proper workforce planning through the usage of workforce analytics can lead to detailed evaluation of the abilities of the human resource, thereby resulting in a productive way of utilizing the abilities. Workforce analytics further enhances the productivity of the firm by identifying occasions, on which the workforce management proves to be inconsistent in terms of its processes, methodology or strategies. Workforce analytics falls under “People Analytics”, which is also referred to as HR Analytics. People Analytics combines data related to human resource from different sources, works on its accurate implementation and finding dependable and authentic results. The technology has become more reliable and enlightening in the recent years. Workforce Analytics is an emerging trend in HR. Along with it comes a set of challenges and opportunities, which demand to be understood before the trend could be turned into a fashion. The paper studies various aspects of Workforce Analytics and the need for it. As organizations grow, there HR grows too. The crucial role that the HR plays is being recognized and therefore the need to analyze it to improve the work performance has emerged. The paper also highlights the key elements that must be included for successful functioning of workforce analytics. The various elements include, flexibility, adaptability, usability, that are essential to the accomplishment of workforce analytics. The paper identifies the role of technology in the working of the software. The hitches that the organization faces can be overcome only if the software is supported by efficient technology. There are various reasons like scattered data, security, precision, etc. owing to which the role of an efficient as well as cost effective technology has magnified. The paper sheds light on such challenges that prove to be a main cause for the “strong popularity and steady growth” of workforce analytics. Since its new to the HR culture, the requirement to make individuals understand its essence and importance prevails. The organizations need to work towards creating an environment which accepts and uses the analytics, further implying the results upon their working style and ethic. The importance of communication within the organization has been brought into the lime light here. The need to bring the employees at ease with the software, to train them to use it well, and extracting the advantages out of it, are all things that can be put into practice if only strong communication flows through the organization. The advantages that it provides the organization with, are immense. Highlighting the advantages, the paper talks about how workforce analytics is not just useful for analyzing and studying the previous and the present outcomes, but it has a wider concept to it. The paper also proposes a workforce analytics model with major steps. The paper examines the advantages and the scope of putting Workforce Analytics and its tools to use. Analytics is widely used in the fields of marketing, sales, finance, investments etc, while in the field of human resource it is still taking its time. The growing awareness of its advantages is resulting in its gradual acceptance and adoption. Companies have begun hiring analytics professionals, and the rate at which they are doing so is a strong and positive indication of how well the organizations have received the concept of workforce analytics. The scope of workforce analytics is grand and the opportunities that lie ahead are great to exploit. The growing pace of how eager organizations are to utilize their human resource to its best capacity is giving rise to relentless competition among organizations. This will certainly bring a new age of analytics into action. The scope is wide and the trend has just begun. © 2020 IJSTR."
s,"People analytics is a rapidly growing field and one that can be daunting for many HR professionals. The sophistication and capability of organizations vary considerably. Some organizations are just starting to get a handle on their data and improve its quality while others are on the cutting edge of predictive analytics. This paper outlines an analytics maturity model and various case studies sharing how organizations have moved from data to action. Examples will demonstrate how companies have embarked on a journey to connect data on employee attitudes, customer loyalty and satisfaction, operations, and financial performance to make more informed evidence-based business decisions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
s,"Purpose: Driven by the rapidly accelerating pace of technology-enabled developments within human resource management (HRM), human resource (HR) analytics is infiltrating the research and business agenda. As one of the first in its field, the purpose of this paper is to explore what the future of HR analytics might look like. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 20 practitioners of HR analytics, based in 11 large Dutch organizations, the authors investigated what the application, value, structure, and system support of HR analytics might look like in 2025. Findings: The findings suggest that, by 2025, HR analytics will have become an established discipline, will have a proven impact on business outcomes, and will have a strong influence in operational and strategic decision making. Furthermore, the development of HR analytics will be characterized by integration, with data and IT infrastructure integrated across disciplines and even across organizational boundaries. Moreover, the HR analytics function may very well be subsumed in a central analytics function – transcending individual disciplines such as marketing, finance, and HRM. Practical implications: The results of the research imply that HR analytics, as a separate function, department, or team, may very well cease to exist, even before it reaches maturity. Originality/value: Empirical research on HR analytics is scarce, and studies on scenarios, values, and structures of expected developments in HR analytics are non-existent. This research intends to contribute to a better understanding of the development of HR analytics, to facilitate business and HR leaders in taking informed decisions on investing in the further development of the HR analytics discipline. Such investments may lead to an enhanced HR analytics capability within organizations, and cultivate the fact-based and data-driven culture that many organizations and leaders try to pursue. © 2017, 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited."
s,"Humans are accustomed to being tool bearers, but what happens when machines become tool bearers, calculating human labour via the use of big data and people analytics by metrics? The Quantified Self in Precarity highlights how, whether it be in insecure 'gig' work or office work, such digitalisation is not an inevitable process-nor is it one that necessarily improves working conditions. Indeed, through unique research and empirical data, Moore demonstrates how workplace quantification leads to high turnover rates, workplace rationalisation and worker stress and anxiety, with these issues linked to increased rates of subjective and objective precarity. Scientific management asked us to be efficient. Now, we are asked to be agile. But what does this mean for the everyday lives we lead? With a fresh perspective on how technology and the use of technology for management and self-management changes the 'quantified', precarious workplace today, The Quantified Self in Precarity will appeal to undergraduate and postgraduate students interested in fields such as Science and Technology, Organisation Management, Sociology and Politics. © 2018 Phoebe V.

s,"Performance assessment is ubiquitous and crucial in people analytics. Scientific impact, particularly, plays a significant role in the academia. This paper attempts to understand researchers' career trajectories by considering the research community as a social network, where individuals build ties with each other via coauthorship. The resulting linkage facilitates information flow and affects researchers' future impact. Consequently, we systematically investigate the career trajectories of researchers with respect to research impact using the social capital theory as our theoretical foundation. Specifically, for early-stage and mid-career academics, we find that connections with prominent researchers associate with greater impact. Brokerage positions, in addition, are beneficial to a researcher's research impact in the long run. For senior researchers, however, the only social network feature that significantly affects their future impact is the reputation of their recently built ties. Finally, we build predictive models on future research impact which can be leveraged by both organizations and individuals. This paper provides empirical evidence for how social networks provide signals on researchers' career dynamics guided by social capital theory. Our findings have implications for individual researchers to strategically plan and promote their careers and for research institutions to better evaluate current as well as prospective employees. © 2020 Association for Information Science and Technology"
s,"A case study of strategic renewal in the Chinese education market, this paper explores a non-directive coaching model and its impact on risk mitigation, knowledge exchange and innovation in strategic renewal through the application of multi-tiered coaching and manager coaches. Through an ethnographic action research methodology, we ask “Can coaching mitigate organisational risk and increase the likelihood of positive outcomes in change management?” and “Can managers, acting as internal coaches, increase knowledge socialisation and mitigate risk in the change management process?” The paper finds that there is no inherent failure rate in the change management process and that a strategic management approach can mitigate risk liberating managers and organisations to seek to create the collaborative environments that support organisational learning and strategic renewal, thus moving beyond a narrative of failure to one of strategic empowerment and a strategic management approach to risk mitigation. We conclude that a data-driven approach to organisational learning and Professional Learning Communities helps teams to ask the right questions and to mitigate risk through better aligning the organisation to its strategic reality, exploiting organisational learning to achieve competitive advantage and ensuring that systems and processes continue to match the emerging strategic reality. © 2021 by the authors."
s,"Data analytics has gained importance in human resource management (HRM) for its ability to provide insights based on data-driven decision-making processes. However, integrating an analytics-based approach in HRM is a complex process, and hence, many organizations are unable to adopt HR Analytics (HRA). Using a framework synthesis approach, we first identify the challenges that hinder the practice of HRA and then develop a framework to explain the different factors that impact the adoption of HRA within organizations. This study identifies the key aspects related to the technological, organizational, environmental, data governance, and individual factors that influence the adoption of HRA. In addition, this paper determines 23 sub-dimensions of these five factors as the crucial aspects for successfully implementing and practicing HRA within organizations. We also discuss the implications of the framework for HR leaders, HR Managers, CEOs, IT Managers and consulting practitioners for effective adoption of HRA in organization. © 2021 Elsevier Inc."

s,"With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, businesses and organizations have acclimated to unconventional and different working ways and patterns, like working from home, working with limited employees at office premises. With the new normal here to stay for the recent future, employees have also adapted to different working environments and customs, which has also resulted in psychological stress and lethargy for many, as they adapt to the new normal and adjust their personal and professional lives. In this work, data visualization techniques and machine learning algorithms have been used to predict employees stress levels. Based on data, we can develop a model that will assist to predict if an employee is likely to be under stress or not. Here, the XGB classifier is used for the prediction process and the results are presented showing that the method facilitates getting a more reliable model performance. After performing interpretation utilizing XGB classifier it is determined that working hours, workload, age, and, role ambiguity have a significant and negative influence on employee performance. The additional factors do not hold much significance when associated to the above discussed. Therefore, It is concluded that concluded that increasing working hours, role ambiguity, the workload would diminish employee representation in all perspectives. © 2020 IEEE."
s,"Over the last decade, a growing number of organizations have started to apply various data-driven computational techniques and algorithmic technologies to manage their workforce. The fundamental objective of these technologies, known as People Analytics, is to enable more effective, objective, and rational decision-making about people. High expectations surround such technologies, as they can drive competitive advantage and innovation through better utilization of human talent. However, the application of algorithms to manage people (rather than supply chains or business processes) entails multiple ethical and practical complexities. In this short paper, we seek to unpack the main assumptions that underlie the use of People Analytics to portray a nuanced and critical picture of its possible ramifications. Based on this critical examination, we outline a research agenda that identifies multiple avenues for future IS research into People Analytics."
s,"Purpose: This paper aims to highlight the importance of Smart Human Resources 4.0 (Smart HR 4.0) and its role as a catalyst in the disruption process in the human resource domain. This paper illustrates the advantages of Smart HR 4.0 in the HR domain by using the example of Credit Suisse, which has extensively used people analytics to reduce employee attrition. Design/methodology/approach: The paper discusses the role of Smart HR 4.0 as a disruptor in the human resource domain. With the help of the Smart HR 4.0 conceptual framework, this paper illustrates how Smart HR 4.0 disrupts the talent on-boarding, talent development, and talent off-boarding process. Findings: An organization would require a successful Smart HR 4.0 strategy to cope up with the challenges of Industry 4.0 transformation. Emerging technologies such as Internet-of-Things, Big Data, and artificial intelligence will automate most of the HR processes, resulting in efficient and leaner HR teams. Both organization structure and leadership style changes would be required for efficient Smart HR 4.0 implementation that would allow HR departments to play a more strategic role in the overall organization growth. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature and body of knowledge in the HR domain by developing a Smart HR 4.0 conceptual framework. This paper discusses how Smart HR 4.0 acts as a catalyst in the disruption of talent ion-boarding, talent development, and talent off-boarding process with the help of emerging technologies and change in the employee generation. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."
s,"We examine human resources practices resulting from the use of big data technologies in knowledge-based service firms that operate under the gafa model. In this sense, people analytics stands as the main strategy for managing the workforce through the analysis of algorithms that arise from the study of interactions within corporate social networks and other spaces for participation in business websites. Our main argument is that these practices are a novelty compared to those used until recent times in other types of firms, given that their central objective now lies in the study of intimacy and emotions happening in social interactions. In conclusion, we establish this is a subjective involvement strategy that aims to generate greater legitimacy due to its “scientific” origin but finally ends up reinforcing the biases of previously used techniques. This work is of a qualitative nature, based on semi-structured interviews with middle and senior managers of knowledge-based service firms established in Argentina. © 2020, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

s,"Purpose: This paper aims to explore predicting employee learning activity via employee characteristics and usage for two online learning tools. Design/methodology/approach: Statistical analysis focused on observational data collected from user logs. Data are analyzed via regression models. Findings: Findings are presented for over 40,000 employees’ learning activity for one year in a multinational technology company. Variables including job level and tool use yielded a predictive model for overall learning behaviors. In addition, relevant differences are found for managers and nonprofessional learning. Research limitations/implications: Importantly, how well employees learned content was not measured. This research is also limited to observational relationships: for example, the online tools were used by self-selected users, instead of randomly assigned. Future research which randomly assigns tool use to employee subgroups could explore causal relationships. Practical implications: This paper presents implications for business analysts and educational technology: how predictive analytics can leverage data to plan programs, the significant challenges for the adoption and usage for online learning tools, and the distinct needs of managers engaging with these tools. Originality/value: Given a growing emphasis on using employee data, it is important to explore how learning behaviors can be made visible in people analytics. While previous research has surveyed employee cultures on learning or explored the socio-psychological factors which contribute to this learning, this paper presents novel data on employee participation in learning programs which illuminates both how HR metrics can productively use this data to reify learning patterns, and how workplace technology designers can consider important factors such as internal hierarchies. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."
s,"Pre-employment screening of social media (SM) has become a common practice to assess prospective candidates' fit to the job and gets increasingly automated with the application of people analytics. Besides some evidence that SM screening negatively affects applicants' job pursuit intention in general, there is a lack of knowledge on the differential effects based on the type of the targeted SM network (private vs. professional) and the nature of the screening agent (human vs. self-learning algorithms). Drawing on signaling theory, we perform a vignette-based experimental study that aims at addressing this gap. The results indicate that only screening of private purpose SM profiles negatively affects job pursuit intention. Surprisingly, self-learning algorithms are perceived more negatively than humans. Our study contributes to IS literature by exploring the role of intelligent decision agents in the context of recruitment and the invasion of privacy in the digital world of work. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.

s,"The increasing use of People Analytics to manage people in organizations ushers in an era of algorithmic management. People analytics are said to allow decision-makers to make evidence-based, bias-free, and objective decisions, and expand workers' opportunities for personal and professional growth. Drawing on a virtue ethics approach, we argue that the use of people analytics in organizations can create a vicious cycle of ethical challenges - algorithmic opacity, datafication, and nudging - which limit people's ability to cultivate their virtue and flourish. We propose that organizations can mitigate these challenges and help workers develop their virtue by reframing people analytics as a fallible companion technology, introducing new organizational roles and practices, and adopting alternative technology design principles. We discuss the implications of this approach for organizations and for the design of people analytics, and propose directions for future research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

s,"The purpose of this paper is to conduct a systematic review by collecting secondary data from published journals on Human Resource Analytics in an effort to shed more light on different issues that relate to the topic such as the processes involved, the emerging trends, the antecedents, the consequences (specifically, organizational effectiveness), and the influences impacting the success of its adoption. This study is of considerable practical relevance as despite having numerous empirical research linking the positive impact of HR Analytics to organizational effectiveness and business competitiveness, the adoption and implementation rates of HR Analytics remain comparatively low. During the time we conducted the research, we faced several issues with the data collection process due to the novelty of the topic but also due to the relevancy and availability of research around the implementation and impact it has on businesses. The results indicate that despite the increase in popularity and interest in HRA, HR professionals still have a long way to go before reaching analytical maturity. Moreover, our research shows that HR is pivoting towards a more strategic function and playing a more curtail role in the organization’s decision making. Workforce Analytics is facing many challenges in regard to its implementation and our study highlights some of these obstacles such as a shortage in data analytics skills within HR, poor IT infrastructure, and insufficient investment from the business. As more organizations integrate analytics into their daily HR operations, we will start to see more challenges and obstacles that will completely change or even disrupt the way we know HR today. Therefore, we urge further exploration and investigation around the implementation of HRA. © 2020, Research Trend. All rights reserved."

s,"When it comes to making promotions, companies rely upon a variety of metrics and rating systems to support their decisions. However, are they looking at the most important metrics and more broadly, how should they identify employees to promote? The literature predominantly focuses on the measurement of performance, but businesses also need instruments that can predict management potential for promotional decision-making. This paper utilizes the data contained in the Human Resources Information System (HRIS) of a company to analyze drivers of potential for promotion among a sample of its workers. Numerous prior studies have been conducted of human resource variables in a variety of organizations. These studies share in common the use of linear models to report which explanatory variables are statistically significant determinants of the dependent variable - in most cases the performance of employees with a focus on the individual's output. What they do not deliver, and what this study provides, in addition to regression studies on employee performance, is an analysis of the drivers of promotion potential for management roles. The perspective of our analysis diverges from others in that its primary focus is to identify future leaders of a company rather than identifying strong individual contributors. The methods used consist of basic statistical procedures, multiple classification methods and graph theory analysis. In our study of managerial potential drivers, the logistic regression model performs with the best predictive accuracy and recognizes which factors in a manager reveals leadership potential. In our study of promotion potential from a teamwork perspective, we show that graph network-based methods adapt well to employee data containing several bilateral relationships while preserving the hierarchy of an organization and providing defensible accuracy. © 2020 IEEE."

Techniques applied include centrality metrics, powerlaw estimation, community detection, and complex network dynamics. Among other results, the authors validate the existence of power-law relationships on project sizes (number of developers). As a methodological contribution, the article demonstrates how network data science can be used to derive a broad spectrum of insights about employee effort and collaboration in organizations.

s,"Developers are using more and more different channels and tools to collaborate, and integrations between these tools are becoming more prevalent. In turn, more data about developers’ interactions at work will become available. These developments will likely make People Analytics — using data to show and improve how people collaborate — more accessible and in turn more important for software developers. Even though developer collaboration has been the focus of several research groups and studies, we believe these changes will qualitatively change how some developers work.

s,"People analytics (PA) is the fastest-growing area of Human Resources Management today, driven significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it will be more crucial when organizations have to decide how to proceed in the “next normal”. Some researches show that HR managers and professionals lack of the “must-have capabilities” (Angrave et al.,.Human Resource Management Journal 26:1–11, 2016), thus highlighting the importance of developing new skills related to the use and implementation of PA; simultaneously, an enrichment of related competencies, which would support the new frame of decision-making activities is requested (Mauro et al.,.Library Review 65:122–135, 2016). Interpreting the recent discussion on Big Data (BD) through the lenses of the resource-based theory, the concept of BD Analytics Capability is used (Gandomi and Haider,.International Journal of Information Management 35:137–144, 2015; Wamba et al.,.Journal of Business Research 70:356–365, 2017) to introduce a theoretical model that considers the HR Departments (HRDs) traditional capabilities required with new skills that consider different flows of information coming from the processing of BD. © The Editor(s) (ifapplicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.2022."
s,"The information technology (IT) services industry is undergoing a rapid change with the growth of market interest in cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security technologies. For service providers to match this pace, they must rapidly transform their workforce in terms of job roles, and do so without incurring excessive cost while continuing to deliver core services. In this paper, we describe a big data approach to enable such a transformation through internal job transfers of suitable employees from legacy areas to growth areas. Toward this end, we use data on employee expertise to mathematically profile skill sets required for growth area jobs and develop a statistical scoring algorithm to prioritize internal candidates to be transferred to those growth area jobs. We describe how we have enacted this analytics procedure within the IT services division of the IBM Corporation and provide empirical results. We also discuss the lessons learned during the deployment, focusing mostly on organizational reasons preventing wide uptake. © 2015 IEEE."
s,"In the era of data science and big data analytics, people analytics help organizations and their human resources (HR) managers to reduce attrition by changing the way of attracting and retaining talent. In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking 'big' by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking 'deep' by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that 'business travel', which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention. © 2013 IEEE."
s,"The present paper proposes a conceptual ontology to evaluate human factors by modelling their key performance indicators and defining these indicators' explanatory factors, manifestations, and diverse corresponding digital footprints. Our methodology incorporates 6 main human resource constructs: performance, engagement, leadership, workplace dynamics, organizational developmental support, and learning and knowledge creation. Using sentiment analysis, we introduce a potential way to evaluate several components of the proposed human factors ontology. We use the Enron email corpus as a test case, to demonstrate how digital footprints can predict such phenomena. In so doing, we hope to encourage further research applying data mining techniques to allow real-time, less costly, and more reliable assessments of human factor patterns and trends. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd"

This study makes theoretical and practical contributions to the field of HR development by exploring the current state of people analytics and people analytics' application to HR development practice. It also enhances scholars' understanding of people analytics within HR development boundaries and provides insights for future research. Finally, this study provides practical guidance for HR development practitioners seeking to leverage people analytics in their work."
w,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the key ingredients that people analytics teams require to contribute to organizational performance. As the information that is currently available is fragmented, it is difficult for organizations to understand what it takes to execute people analytics successfully. Design/methodology/approach To identify the key ingredients, a narrative literature review was conducted using both traditional people analytics and broader business intelligence literature. The findings were summarized in the People Analytics Effectiveness Wheel. Findings The People Analytics Effectiveness Wheel identifies four categories of ingredients that a people analytics team requires to be effective. These are enabling resources, products, stakeholder management and governance structure. Under each category, multiple sub-themes are discussed, such as data and infrastructure; senior management support; and knowledge, skills, abilities and other characteristics (KSAOs) (enablers). Practical implications Many organizations are still trying to set up their people analytics teams, and many others are struggling to improve decision-making by using people analytics. For these companies, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current literature and describes what it takes to contribute to organizational performance using people analytics. Originality/value This paper is designed to provide organizations and researchers with a comprehensive understanding of what it takes to execute people analytics successfully. By using the People Analytics Effectiveness Wheel as a guideline, scholars are now better equipped to research the processes that are required for the ingredients to be truly effective."
w,"For more than two decades, academicians and practitioners have been theorising the role of people analytics in enhancing the efficiency, effectiveness and impact of the human resource (HR) management function, thereby prescribing people analytics as an enabler of HR strategic partnership. The objective of this study is to identify and synthesise existing literature on people analytics and its conceptualised efficacy. This is done with a view to assess how and why people analytics enhances HR as a field and elevates it to a function of strategic significance. The study uses the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) framework for systematic literature review to address the research objective. A total of 90 articles on the subject are identified majorly from Scopus. The analysis of this literature reveals four significant themes underscoring the role people analytics can play in enabling HR as a field and function. These include the following: (a) application of people analytics leads to greater vertical, horizontal and external alignment of the HR function; (b) people analytics facilitates better integration of HR management with the organisation's strategic planning process; (c) people analytics aids the demonstration of causal links between HR management and business performance; and finally (d) people analytics endows the field with scientific rigour, consistency and resulting credibility. The study contributes to the existing knowledge on people analytics and HR strategy linkage by building a foundation and offering specific propositions for empirical enquiry relating the two. The significance of the study also emanates from its focus on the efficacy of people analytics which is being viewed as an HR approach with immense potential."
w,"The increasing use of People Analytics to manage people in organizations ushers in an era of algorithmic management. People analytics are said to allow decision-makers to make evidence-based, bias-free, and objective decisions, and expand workers' opportunities for personal and professional growth. Drawing on a virtue ethics approach, we argue that the use of people analytics in organizations can create a vicious cycle of ethical challenges - algorithmic opacity, datafication, and nudging - which limit people's ability to cultivate their virtue and flourish. We propose that organizations can mitigate these challenges and help workers develop their virtue by reframing people analytics as a fallible companion technology, introducing new organizational roles and practices, and adopting alternative technology design principles. We discuss the implications of this approach for organizations and for the design of people analytics, and propose directions for future research."
w,"In this paper we take stock of the current state of People Analytics and identify ways to increase business impact. We suggest a fourth wave of people analytics, which focuses on impact in MY company, not compared to someone else (benchmarking, reporting), not just mimicking someone else (best practice), and not being enamored with the research methodologies (predictive analytics). This pivots people analytics towards answering questions of value to your key stakeholders (employees, senior management and boards inside and investors, customers and communities outside the organization) instead of questions mostly relevant to HR professionals or regulators. We outline a guidance framework for how people analytics can help shape practical solutions for your company to outperform in areas relevant for you. We argue a focus on guidance will amplify the business impact of people analytics, making it more relevant for management actions."
w,"Technological advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) are heralding a new era of analytics and data-driven decision-making. Organisations increasingly rely on people analytics to optimise human resource management practices in areas such as recruitment, performance evaluation, personnel development, health and retention management. Recent progress in the field of AI and ever-increasing volumes of digital data have raised expectations and contributed to a very positive image of people analytics. However, transferring and applying the efficiency-driven logic of analytics to manage humans carries numerous risks, challenges, and ethical implications. Based on a theorising review our paper analyses perils that can emerge from the use of people analytics. By disclosing the underlying assumptions of people analytics and offering a perspective on current and future technological advancements, we identify six perils and discuss their implications for organisations and employees. Then, we illustrate how these perils may aggravate with increasing analytical power of people analytics, and we suggest directions for future research. Our theorising review contributes to information system research at the intersection of analytics, artificial intelligence, and human-algorithmic management."
w,"People analytics has brought a paradigm shift in the processes, technologies and systems of organizations. Success is driven here through data-driven methodologies. The primary objective of this research is to identify, rank and interrelate challenges affecting the adoption of people analytics in India. The interpretative structural modelling (ISM) approach is applied to rank and interrelate these challenges in the Indian context. MICMAC analysis is conducted to reveal the driving power and dependence of these challenges of people analytics. The MICMAC analysis also indicates the relative importance and interdependence between these challenges in the Indian context. During the first phase of the research, 12 challenges are identified from the literature, and these people analytics challenges are validated based on expert opinions. During the second phase, ISM identifies 'Leveraging existing enterprise resources' as the most important challenge in the Indian context among the 11 validated challenges. MICMAC analysis identifies all 11 challenges as 'linkage challenges' with high dependence and driving power. For researchers, this methodology facilitates further carrying out exploratory studies and focusing their interactions through hierarchical structures. The study investigates the core issue among many issues faced by people analytics professionals. Second, it has methodological novelty in the context. Finally, it points to multidimensional implications for various stakeholders in people analytics in the Indian context."
w,"The present paper demonstrates the opportunities of using People Data Analytics technology for a data-driven approach to Human Resource Management along with Big Data and HR Analytics. Our aim was to study the most popular trends in collecting, analyzing, and using workforce data and suggest the ways companies can improve their Human Resource Management by incorporating data and analytics technologies into their people analytics strategies. Drawing on our analysis of the approaches to using People Data Analytics in Human Resource Management, we identify the key applications and services that can be employed, describe data to be analyzed, single out specific methods and technologies, suggest prospects for the development of HR functions to provide better insights into employee performance levels and deliver sustainable competitive advantage. We outline the main characteristics and competencies required for any professional involved in People Data Analytics and offer a framework for the educational program in People Data Analytics. It is imperative for the program to include courses in Statistics, Econometrics, Employee Performance Evaluation, Data Visualization, as well as Use of Data Processing Software."
w,"The study approaches one of the most promissing trends in the human capital management: People Analytics. Lining the Triple Bottom Line concept of sustainability, the organization's core competences and analytical algorithms, this study aims to develop an integrated model to strategically insert People Analytics into the business. In an exploratory way, People Analytics was bibliographically mapped, approaching its potential on behalf of the strategic management of the Human capital. The developed model integrates people, processes and competencies, advocating that the correlation between such components with people management methodologies and analytical algorithms propitiates a human management oriented to the organizational sustainability."
w,"Despite people analytics being a hype topic and attracting attention from both academia and practice, we find only few academic studies on the topic, with practitioners driving discussions and the development of the field. To better understand people analytics and the role of information technology, we perform a thorough evaluation of the available software tools. We monitored social media to identify and analyze 41 people analytics tools. Afterward, we sort these tools by employing a coding scheme focused on five dimensions: methods, stakeholders, outcomes, data sources, and ethical issues. Based on these dimensions, we classify the tools into five archetypes, namely employee surveillance, technical platforms, social network analytics, human resources analytics, and technical monitoring. Our research enhances the understanding of implicit assumptions underlying people analytics in practice, elucidates the role of information technology, and links this novel topic to established research in the information systems discipline."
w,"People analytics depicts the algorithmization of human resources management characterized by the data-driven automation and support of people-related processes or tasks. On the one hand, people analytics promises productivity increases through optimizing workforce planning, hiring, or talent development. On the other hand, the extensive data collection and analysis of employees' behaviors can be perceived as invasive, raising privacy concerns. This debate cannot only be explained by diverging norms and values, for example, practitioners realizing commercial opportunities while being criticized by academic commentaries. Instead, an alternative explanation suggests that the opposing views can be reconciled by diving into the conceptual differences regarding what analytical methods and data sources people analytics entails. Hence, this paper proposes the conceptions of operational and strategic people analytics based on a literature review of academics' and practitioners' literature. Four propositions about these conceptions' privacy and performance implications are derived. Future research should empirically validate these propositions."
w,"Graphs, also called networks, consist of vertices and edges. They are used to represent the interactions between different entities and have found applications in a wide range of scientific fields. Handbook of Graphs and Networks in People Analytics introduces graphs to specialists in the field of people analytics. In this review, we critique this book from different aspects."
w,"Purpose - Given its relative novelty, the field of people analytics remains rather obscure in terms of its success criteria. The purpose of this paper is to unveil some of the hidden secrets of people analytics. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews the common characteristics of those companies who have already been successful with it in their operations to date. Findings - These 16 best practices cover the role of the CHRO and the employees as well as HR's general position within a company. Practical implications - While not all of the 16 best practices need to be in place, incorporating a few of them will provide significant benefit to businesses and employees. Social implications - While several of the best practices laid out in this paper directly impact personnel policies, they also all empower HR managers to be a force for good through optimised people analytics. Originality/value - The paper presents a hitherto scattered set of best practices as forerunners in the novel field of people analytics."
w,"Although research identifies analytical and storytelling skills as the two broad human capital inputs required to perform people analytics, further research is required to better understand how People Analysts that is, the enactors of people analytics, perceive the impact of these skills on their performance. Accordingly, this study draws on the human capital resource (HCR) and HCR complementarity frameworks to investigate the individual and collective impact of analytical and storytelling skills on People Analysts perceived job performance. A mixed-method sequential explanatory research design is adopted, finding mixed results. Consistent with existing research, results from Phase 1 find People Analysts perceive storytelling skills to be positively associated with their job performance. However, contrary to existing claims, the findings reveal that analytical skills are only perceived to be significant in influencing People Analysts job performance when combined with storytelling skills, supporting a complementarity HCR relationship. To further explain the findings from Phase 1, Phase 2 involved collecting data from 50 people analytics professionals via semi-structured interviews. Results from the thematic analysis reinforce the survey findings while also illustrating that People Analysts perceive the complementarity relationship between analytical and storytelling skills as important for improving job performance. Accordingly, we argue that debate in this area should be reframed to acknowledge the necessity of complementarities in building people analytics capabilities."
w,"Data Analysis has been one of the most internal themes of the times. In the Digital Transformation that we live in today, there are several and varied as its implementations. However, in Human Resources, even though Human Resource Management Systems (HRIS) is already rooted, the development of data analysis is slow to appear. This is due to the scepticism existing in the area's professionals regarding People Analytics and the ethical issue of reducing people to data. This work discusses what People Analytics is, what topics can be developed, how HRIS can be transformed and what the future this area will have within companies. This work intends to contribute in this topic discussion, since it is relevant on Human Resources Management jobs, but also on the technological functions, mainly on information systems implementation to data collection, and in data analytics, both to promote data-driven approaches and decisions."
w,"The best companies compete with people analytics. They maximize the business value of their people to gain competitive advantage. This article proposes a network data science approach to people analytics. Using data from a software development organization, the article models developer contributions to project repositories as a bipartite weighted graph. This graph is projected into a weighted one-mode developer network to model collaboration. Techniques applied include centrality metrics, power-law estimation, community detection, and complex network dynamics. Among other results, the authors validate the existence of power-law relationships on project sizes (number of developers). As a methodological contribution, the article demonstrates how network data science can be used to derive a broad spectrum of insights about employee effort and collaboration in organizations. The authors discuss implications for managers and future research directions."
w,"Skills and competences of people participating in online professional networks constitute an ever-increasing new source for data collection and analysis. An important sub-domain of human resources management (HRM) is the recruitment process. Job advertisements and people profiles are main parts of recruitment and since are now available online, they constitute a key factor of a new e-recruitment era. Data mining for e-recruitment analysis is important in order to extract a knowledge base for people analytics. Skills and competences are the key variables for people analytics and can be drawn from job advertisements. Leveraging the raw information of online job offers, provides a rich source for people analytics. Detecting the appropriate skills and competences for a job from raw text data and associate them with a job seeker is an increasing challenge. The main objective of this paper is the proposal of a framework aiming to collect online job advertisements from a web source which concerns IT job offers and to extract from the raw text the required skills and competences for specific jobs. The selected professional networking web source is StackOverflow and multivariate statistical data analysis was used to test the correlations between skills and competences in the job offers dataset. The present work falls in a relatively new field of research, concerning the competence mining of peopleware data with special focus on software development."
w,"Researchers in the field of HRM and Strategic HRM have for several decades engaged in research endeavours to identify the link between HR investments and firm performance. Despite this, the field still has some way to go to definitively demonstrate this causal relationship; partly due to the cross-sectional nature of much of this research. In the current paper, we give a brief overview of the SHRM field and the benefits that the new subfield of People Analytics (PA) might bring to the area. We also conduct a brief survey of research in Insider Econometrics, an approach used in Personnel Economics to produce empirical estimates of the value of HR practices, to highlight longitudinal intra-firm research in economics that could provide insights to research exploring the HR investment-performance link (important in both SHRM and PA fields). We discuss the value of combining the business impact perspective of People Analytics that has a unique 'inside' (intra-firm) position, with the longitudinal intra-firm analysis approaches utilized in Insider Econometrics. We suggest that People Analytics researchers, who are able to draw on the theoretical developments in HRM field, would benefit from exploring existing research insights and methodological techniques used within the field of Insider Econometrics."
w,"Time is central to the purported business value of analytics. Yet, research has adopted a simplistic, 'clock' interpretation of time, ignoring its complex and socially embedded nature. There is also an overemphasis on analytics software and not on the people using them. Although analytics may be 'fast' to realise business value, it must cater to temporal complexities of organisations and people using it. Drawing on the temporality theory, this study develops temporal factors to examine the value of analytics. We also develop a research agenda that identifies opportunities to examine time, temporal personalities and other factors when people use analytics in the organisation."
w,"This article is about a training project within a leading Italian insurance company, based on people analytics and a blended learning program enhanced by e-REAL (R) and artificial intelligence. The intervention started with an Organizational Network Analysis regarding informal and spontaneous communication from which skills and ideas arise: this is the starting point that allows the HR Team to take decisions and outline strategies to support growth. Then, a Sentiment Analysis was performed, in order to track and monitor the climate in different clusters within the company, by mapping sentiment through natural language processing algorithms (all data anonymized). This step also opened to a Tensions Analysis targeting expressions of anger or misalignment with the corporate culture. As a further step, an Employees Potential Chart was developed. As an output of this phase, the HR Team was provided with essential metrics such as performance peaks, relational networks, communication and collaboration among teams and departments, key competencies, and skills. Then, a learning and development plan based on people analytics was designed: the main elements were interactive tutorials and immersive online experiences made by a multimedia and visual storytelling approach, as well as an extensive interaction within an escape room animated also by realistic avatars. A number of other methodologies were introduced as a further step: first of all training on-the-job, coaching, and mentoring. All the interventions were based on a large amount of people analytics collected from gamified activities, allowing for micro-targeted and highly precise interventions that are very innovative in the field of learning and development."
w,"Attrition models combine variables into statistical algorithms to understand and predict employee turnover. People analytics teams and external vendors use attrition models to offer insights and to develop organisational interventions. However, if attrition models or other data-driven models inform employment decisions, model scores may then be subjected to civil rights laws and diversity concerns resulting from group differences in scores. This paper discusses adverse impact when building attrition models, outlining how researchers test for adverse impact in this context, strategies to reduce group differences and how attrition modelling and other human resources 'big data' predictions fit within larger validity frameworks. Procedures were applied to field data in an applied demonstration of an attrition model with disparate impact. Model revisions resulted in adverse impact reductions while simultaneously maintaining model validity. Collectively, this paper provides timely attention to important aspects of the people analytics, turnover and legal domains."
w,"In times where change is a natural part of our daily corporate reality, global markets push international competition and demographic changes make it difficult to find qualified employees, the human as a major factor for organizational success receives raised attention. Companies have a great interest to know and to leverage the causal impact of emotions, needs and behaviors on strategic business areas (e.g. employee recruiting, employee commitment, customer satisfaction, competitive advantage). With a growing volume and variety of data made available by IT-supported processes and new data sources such as mobile data or corporate social media data, a new field of practice emerges: people analytics. This growing area of data analyses on all kinds of different questions relating to employee issues and leadership in organizations overlaps in many ways with the empirical psychological research of the last decades. People analytics yields a unique chance for organizational psychologists to delve into corporate waters and contribute their expertise to corporate research projects."
w,"In the era of data science and big data analytics, people analytics help organizations and their human resources (HR) managers to reduce attrition by changing the way of attracting and retaining talent. In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking 'big' by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking 'deep' by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that 'business travel', which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention."
w,"Ability to properly work with quantitative data is crucial for each segment of a company including Human Resource Management (HRM). People analytics represents a data- driven approach to HRM and implementation of quantitative models in decision processing of company's workforce planning. In this work we present a combined way of using a multiple correspondence analysis as multivariate analysis method that integrates ideas from multidimensional scaling in the field of people analytics. Several managers formulated ideas concerning possible dependencies and associations among length and frequency of absenteeism events, age of an employee, sex and employee's designation (blue collar, white collar). These ideas are formulated as hypotheses and tested on data set summarizing information about more than five thousand employees of six production companies from Moravian-Silesian region during period 01/2015 - 12/2016. Associations and particular patterns among specified categorical variables are interpreted using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). The main objective of this study is to discuss obtained information with focus on implementation of the results in the decision processing of HRM. We also conclude that MCA represents appropriate statistical tool for visualizing HRM data."
w,"Developers are using more and more different channels and tools to collaborate, and integrations between these tools are becoming more prevalent. In turn, more data about developers' interactions at work will become available. These developments will likely make People Analytics - using data to show and improve how people collaborate more accessible and in turn more important for software developers. Even though developer collaboration has been the focus of several research groups and studies, we believe these changes will qualitatively change how some developers work. We provide an introduction to existing work in this field and outline where it could be headed."
w,"Human Resource (HR) analytics (or people analytics) includes a large family of methods and applications aimed to analyse people-related data and build robust and effective HR-centred organizational processes. The development of HR analytics is a relevant trend, of major interest for scholars and practitioners, and this is particularly true in the postpandemic scenario, characterized by growing volatility, uncertainty and complexity. Such conditions are requiring organizations to increasingly put human resources at the centre of their resilience building and transformation processes. Advanced intelligence and decision support capabilities are crucial to build people-centred organizations, and new theory contributions and practitioner advancements are thus needed to provide robust conceptual frameworks and real-life applications. In such endeavour, we present HUMANWISE, an integrated HR analytics system providing analytics tools to support workforce status monitoring, competence re-allocation and development, and predictive analysis. We adopt an interdisciplinary and multi-dimensional approach and a mixed research process, which includes a systematic review of literature on HR analytics and a design science and group model building activity, aimed to involve key stakeholders in the conceptualization and development effort. We describe the conceptual architecture of the HR analytics system, with key design choices in terms of data input, processing and output. Next, we formulate a set of corporate scenarios and an illustrative dashboard to generate decision support functionalities for company managers and provide them with insights useful to build more robust HR-centred transformation plans."
w,"Cyber Threat Hunting is an emerging cyber security activity. Recent studies show that, although similar actions like threat hunting are being actively practiced in some organization, security administrator and policy makers are far from being satisfied with their effectiveness. Most security professionals lack expertise in data analytics while most people with data analytics skills lack security knowledge. To understand the necessity of threat hunting education at university level, we organized a Threat Hunting Competition on campus with generated logs. In this paper, we identify skills needed for cyber threat hunting, describe the data generation process as well as the usage of logs to teach threat hunting at universities."
w,"Organizations are transforming as they adopt new technologies and use new sources of data, changing the experiences of employees and pushing organizational researchers to respond. As employees perform their daily activities, they generate vast digital data. These data, when combined with established methods and new analytic techniques, create unprecedented opportunities for studying human behavior at work and have fueled the rise of people analytics as a new institutional field of practice. In this chapter, I describe the emerging field of people analytics and new organizational phenomena that accompany the use of data and algorithms. These practices are affecting how individuals, groups, and organizations function, ranging from decision-making processes and work procedures, to communication and collaboration, to attempts to monitor and control employees. In each of these domains, I describe recent research and propose new research directions. Many of these domains intersect with the emerging field of Computational Social Science, in which disciplinary scholars are applying computational methods to an expanding array of digitized data, pursuing interests that extend far into the organizational domain. Organizational scholars are well-positioned to bridge organizational and disciplinary advances to stay at the forefront of research on the future of work. (c) 2023 The Author.

w,"During our tenure on Google's People Analytics team, we have participated in dozens of research partnerships. Some have been wildly successful, resulting in changes to our own organizational practices or policies as well as academic publications. Other partnerships have been less fruitful, largely because both science and organizations are messy and unpredictable. But no matter the outcome, nearly all of our partnerships have come about in the same waya way overlooked by the authors in their article (Lapierre et al., 2018)."
w,"The systematic application of analytical methods on human resources (HR)-related (big) data is referred to as HR analytics or people analytics. Typical problems in HR analytics include the estimation of churn rates, the identification of knowledge and skill in an organization, and the prediction of success on a job. HR analytics, as opposed to the simple use of key performance indicators, is a growing field of interest because of the rapid growth of volume, velocity, and variety of HR data, driven by the digitalization of work processes. Personnel files used to be in steel lockers in the past. They are now stored in company systems, along with data from hiring processes, employee satisfaction surveys, e-mails, and process data. With the growing prevalence of HR analytics, a discussion around its ethics needs to occur. The objective of this paper is to discuss the ethical implications of the application of sophisticated analytical methods to questions in HR management. This paper builds on previous literature in algorithmic fairness that focuses on technical options to identify, measure, and reduce discrimination in data analysis. This paper applies to HR analytics the ethical frameworks discussed in other fields including medicine, robotics, learning analytics, and coaching."
w,"Relational analytics-the leveraging of data on workplace relationships-acts as a complement to traditional people analytics and moves scholars and practitioners closer to an understanding of the realities of the modern workplace. This article serves as a primer for relational analytics by highlighting the potential of the perspective for human resources, the levels of analysis that can be used to study relational analytics, and some of the common theoretical perspectives employed in this area. We introduce the 15 articles in the special issue by positioning them within broader trends we see in the field of relational analytics. Finally, we provide commentary on challenges and future directions in relational analytics with a focus on how the articles in this special issue may serve as examples of best practices and inspiration for future research and practice."
w,"The advancement of data technology such as machine learning and artificial intelligence has broadened the scope of human resources (HR) analytics, commonly referred to as people analytics. This field has seen significant growth in recent years as organizations increasingly rely on algorithm-based predictive tools for HR-related decision making. However, its application in the public sector is not yet fully understood. This study examined the concepts and practices of HR analytics through a thematic review, and proposed a five-step process (define, collect, analyze, share, and reflect) for implementation in the public sector-the process aims to assist with the integration of HR analytics in public personnel management practices. By analyzing cases in both the public and private sectors, this study identified key lessons for functional areas such as workforce planning, recruitment, HR development, and performance management. This research also identified the necessary conditions for introducing HR analytics in public organizations, including data management, staff capabilities, and acceptance, and discussed the potential challenges of privacy, integrity, algorithmic bias, and publicness."
w,"Surveillance capitalists like Google and Amazon will do whatever they can to corner supply routes to data about us and our actions. In Zuboff's lengthy book The age of surveillance capitalism, we learn about the strategic and often underhand means by which these data are captured, and the 'instrumentarian' ideology that provides the logic for this enterprise. Zuboff shows that the aim of advertisers and 'people analytics' advocates is to use our personal data to determine our behavior. At stake is free will and our 'right to the future tense'. In this book review, I reflect on Zuboff 's analysis of how Big Tech, as Big Other, is controlling our lives. I first highlight the prescience of the book's arguments. I then compare aspects of the book with earlier tomes that were critical of new technology, to argue that taking a deterministic view of peoples' relationship with technology may inadvertently support the hyped narrative that data analytics and algorithms are all-powerful."
w,"This paper proposes a systematic framework to integrate learning analytics into serious games for people with intellectual disabilities. Serious games for an inclusive learning environment need to be prudently designed with adaptive and measurable competencies to meet the needs of the target users. The recent emergence of learning analytics provides a capability to capture important data in real time from within the highly interactive nature of serious games to better understand and enhance the learning process. Although previous research has addressed different applications of learning analytics in serious games, few studies have investigated the needs of individuals with disabilities. This paper proposes a framework for serious games analytics specialised for people with intellectual disabilities (SGAPID) for the purpose of supporting the integration of learning analytics within serious games to create an inclusive learning environment. We provide a framework based on previous studies in both learning analytics, serious games and educational technologies for people with intellectual disabilities. The framework consists of three central components, namely learner profiling, learning adaptation and learning evaluation. It provides needed guidance for educational application developers and reflects the contemporary trends in educational technologies. The SGAPID framework will also be valuable for the design, implementation, evaluation and adaptation of serious games for inclusive learning and teaching at the group or individual level."
w,"Frequently humans are invited to engage with modern visual forms: emoji, emoticons, pictograms. Some of these forms are finding their way into the workplace, understood as augmentations to workplace atmospheres. What has been called the 'quantified workplace' requires its workers to log their rates of stress, wellbeing and subjective sense of productivity on a scale of 1-5 or by emoji, in a context in which Human Resources (HR) professionals develop a vocabulary of Workforce Analytics, People Analytics, Human Capital Analytics or Talent Analytics, and all this in the context of managing the work environment or its atmosphere. Atmosphere is mood, a compote of emotions. Emotions are a part of a human package characterized as 'the quantified self', a self intertwined with - subject to but also compliant with - tracking and archiving. The logical step for managing atmospheres is to track emotions at a granular and large-scale level. Through the concept of the digital crowd, rated and self-rating, as well as emotion-tracking strategies, the human resource (as worker and consumer) engages in a new politics of the crowd, organized around what political philosopher Jodi Dean calls, affirmatively, 'secondary visuality', high-circulation communication fusing speech, writing and image as a new form. This is the visuality of communicative, or social media, capitalism. But to the extent that it is captured by HR, is it an exposure less to crowd-sourced democracy, and more a stage in turning the employee into an on-the-shelf item in a digital economy warehouse, assessed by Likert scales? While HR works on new atmospheres of work, what other atmospheres pervade the context of labour, and can these be deployed in the generation of other types of affect, ones that work towards the free association of labour and life?"
w,"Given a corpus of employee peer reviews from a large corporation where each review is structured into pros and cons, what are the prevalent traits that employees talk about? How can we describe the performance of an employee with just a few sentences, that help us interpret what their work is praised and criticized for? What is the best way to summarize an employee's reviews, while preserving the content and sentiment as well as possible? In this work, we study a large collection of corporation-wide employee peer reviews from a technology enterprise. Motivated by the challenges we outline in our analysis of employee review data, our work makes two main contributions in the domain of people analytics: (a) Sentiment-Aspect Model (SAM): we introduce a stylized log-linear model that identifies the hidden aspects and sentiment within an employee peer review corpus, (b) Interpretable Sentiment-Aspect Representations (EMPLOYEE2VEC): using SAM, we produce a vector space embedding for each employee, containing an overall sentiment score per aspect, and (c) Summarization of Employee Peer Reviews (PEERSUM): we summarize an employee's peer reviews with just a few sentences which reflect the most prevalent traits and associated sentiment for the employee as much as possible. We show that our model SAM can use the structure present in the dataset as supervision to discover meaningful latent traits and sentiment embodied in the reviews. Our employee vector representations EMPLOYEE2VEC provide a compact, interpretable overview of their evaluation. The review summaries extracted by PEERSUM provide text that explains the professional performance of an employee in a succinct and objectively quantifiable way. We also show how to use our techniques for people analytics tasks such as the analysis of thematic differences between departments, regions, and genders."
w,"Modern corporate activities are increasingly moving from the traditional way to teleworking. However, as teleworking spreading, the problem of declining employee engagement among teleworkers also comes to the fore. To address this issue, we propose a new approach based on the concept of interactive people analytics. It uses daily video reports to increase interaction between organization members in teleworking, and by analyzing video reports it is expected to detect changes in employee engagement for its maintenance. In this paper, a utility study of using a short video as a daily report in teleworking is presented as well. From the analysis of paralinguistic cues of collected video report samples with corresponding ratings on engagement, it is found there exists relation between paralinguistic cues and engagement in the video."
w,"This study provides a comprehensive examination of the current research landscape of People Analytics (PA) from Human Resource Development (HRD) perspectives. By leveraging the methodologies of bibliometrics and topic modeling, the paper aims to illuminate key trends and emerging themes. By conducting a comparative analysis of topics and grouped themes from topic modeling and clusters from bibliocoupling, the study reveals a convergence in research focuses. This convergence is particularly evident in areas such as workforce planning and management, data-informed decision-making, applying analytics to various HR functions, and emphasizing the ethical and societal implications of data analytics in HR. The paper also identifies gaps and future research needs for HRD research in the current PA landscape and discusses fertile grounds for future research."
w,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the use of bibliometric indicators as a people analytics tool for examining research performance outcome differences in faculty mobility and turnover. Design/methodology/approach Employing bibliometric information from research databases, the publication, citations, h-index and newly developed individual annualized h-index (hIa-index) for a sample of university faculty is examined (N = 684). Information relating to turnover decisions from a human resource (HR) information system and bibliometric data from a research database are combined to explore research performance differences across cohorts of retained, resigned or terminated faculty over a five-year period in a single university. Findings Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results indicate traditional bibliometric indicators of h-index, publication count and citation count which are limited in their ability to identify performance differences between employment status cohorts. Results do show some promise for the newly developed hIa-index, as it is found to be significantly lower for terminated faculty (p < 0.001), as compared to both retained and resigned faculty. Multinomial logistic regression analysis also confirms the hIa metric as a predictor of terminated employment status. Research limitations/implications First, the results imply that the hIa-index, which controls for career length and elements of coauthorship is a superior bibliometric indicator for comparison of research performance. Practical implications Results suggest that the hIa metric may serve as a useful tool for the examination of employment decisions for universities. It also highlights the potential usefulness of bibliometric indicators for people analytics and the examination of employment decisions, performance management and faculty turnover in research-intensive higher education contexts. Originality/value This empirical paper is entirely unique. No research has previously examined the issue of turnover in a university setting using the bibliometric measures employed here. This is a first example of the potential use of hIa bibliometric index as an HR analytics tool for the examination of HR decisions such as employee turnover in the university context."
w,"Organizations use People Analytics (PA) to pursue strategic planning of their activities. PA offers a strategic view of the organization, including the understanding of people's behavior. This article presents a new probabilistic approach to map behavioral profiles. It collects self-perception of personality traits and classifies persons into four archetypes. Additionally, it computes behavior characteristics at different intensities, generating nine situational indicators, such as energy and motivation. Our approach also presents thirteen areas of talent and their relationship to the behavioral profiles. We also test the assertiveness of our proposed approach by statistically evaluating it considering the perspectives of employees, employees leaders, and expert psychologists. Experimental results show that our approach is effective, achieving 93.22% +/- 3.06% agreement for observed employees, 90.80% +/- 4.60% for leader observers, and 93.66% +/- 1.28% for expert observers."
w,"Introduction: this study aims to develop a review about People Analytics based on the literature in the area available in theWeb of Science and Scopus databases. The concept was explored, as well as studies that demonstrate how to use it in organizations, the advantages and challenges of its application and the perception of managers about this application. Method: the research was carried out based on articles available in the above-mentioned databases, published from 2005 onwards. Results: the results show that special attention should be given to the origin of the analyzed data, as well as a correct analysis of the available material is fundamental in order to generate information and knowledge that represent value for the organizations. Conclusions: it is also important to note that the training of Human Resources professionals in the use of data is emphasized in several articles that composed the analysis reported in this study."
w,"media data represents the fuel for advanced analytics concerning people's behaviors, physiological and health status. These analytics include identifying users' depression levels via Twitter and then recommend remedies. Remedies come in the form of suggesting some accounts to follow, displaying motivational quotes, or even recommending a visit to a psychiatrist. This paper proposes a remedy recommendation system which exploits case-based reasoning (CBR) with random forest. The system recommends the appropriate remedy for a person. The main contribution of this work is the creation of an automated, data-driven, and scalable adaptation module without human interference. The results of every stage of the system were verified by certified psychiatrist. Another contribution of this work is setting the weights in case similarity measurement by the features' importance, extracted from the depression identification system. CBR retrieval accuracy (exact hit) reached 82% while the automatic adaptation accuracy (exact remedy) reached 88%. The adaptation presented an error-tolerance advantage which enhances the overall accuracy."
w,"Interaction is the cornerstone of how people perform tasks and gain insight in visual analytics. However, people's inherent cognitive biases impact their behavior and decision making during their interactive visual analytic process. Understanding how bias impacts the visual analytic process, how it can be measured, and how its negative effects can be mitigated is a complex problem space. Nonetheless, recent work has begun to approach this problem by proposing theoretical computational metrics that are applied to user interaction sequences to measure bias in real-time. In this paper, we implement and apply these computational metrics in the context of anchoring bias. We present the results of a formative study examining how the metrics can capture anchoring bias in real-time during a visual analytic task. We present lessons learned in the form of considerations for applying the metrics in a visual analytic tool. Our findings suggest that these computational metrics are a promising approach for characterizing bias in users' interactive behaviors."
w,"This article reports on a participant ethnography of a people analytics (PA) team operating within the human resources (HR) function of a European multinational corporation at the cutting edge of PA development. Despite their analytical expertise, this team experienced significant dissonance between their desired image of PA work and the actualities of PA practice. Our analysis explains this dissonance through two prevalent identity performance scripts: 'customerization' and 'action-orientation'. Taken together these scripts were identified as having a restrictive impact on the production of more scientifically rigorous PA work. Further, both of these scripts were found to be imbued with cynicism, whereby PA practitioners distance themselves from the commercial presentation of their work outputs. The article reveals how management preferencing of presentational and commercial considerations over those of scientific rigour may result in a failure to generate the level of organisational benefits promoted by the optimistic accounts in current literature, with negative implications for the reputational profile of PA."
w,"This mixed-method 'scoping review' mapped the emergence of the term People Analytics (PA), the value propositions offered by vendors of PA tools and services and the PA skillsets being sought by professionals. Analysis of academic research and online search traffic since 2002 revealed changes in the relative trajectory of PA and conceptually related terms over the past fifteen years, indicating both the re-branding of similar innovations and a differentiation of priorities and communities of practice. The market in commercial PA tools and services is diverse, offering numerous functional and strategic benefits, although published evidence of these outcomes remains sparse. Companies marketing PA systems and services emphasise benefits to employers more than to personnel. Across the sources examined, including specialised online courses, PA was largely aligned with HRM, however its development reflects the shifting focus of HR departments from supporting functional to strategic organisational requirements. Consideration of ethical issues was largely absent."
w,"Organisations are increasingly relying on people analytics to aid human resources decision-making. One application involves using machine learning to automatically infer applicant characteristics from employment interview responses. However, management research has provided scant validity evidence to guide organisations' decisions about whether and how best to implement these algorithmic approaches. To address this gap, we use closed vocabulary text mining on mock video interviews to train and test machine learning algorithms for predicting interviewee's self-reported (automatic personality recognition) and interviewer-rated personality traits (automatic personality perception). We use 10-fold cross-validation to test the algorithms' accuracy for predicting Big Five personality traits across both rating sources. The cross-validated accuracy for predicting self-reports was lower than large-scale investigations using language in social media posts as predictors. The cross-validated accuracy for predicting interviewer ratings of personality was more than double that found for predicting self-reports. We discuss implications for future research and practice."
w,"Most companies have elaborate procedures for managing capital. They require a compelling business case for any new capital investment. They set hurdle rates. They delegate authority carefully, prescribing spending Limits for each level. An organization's time, by contrast, goes largely unmanaged. Bain & Company, with which all three authors are associated, used innovative people analytics tools to examine the time budgets of 17 large corporations. It discovered that companies are awash in e-communications; meeting time has skyrocketed; real collaboration is limited; dysfunctional meeting behavior is on the rise; formal controls are rare; and the consequences of all this are few. The authors outline eight practices for managing organizational time. Among them are: Make meeting agendas clear and selective; create a zero-based time budget; require business cases for all initiatives; and standardize the decision process. Some forward-thinking companies bring as much discipline to their time budgets as to their capital budgets. As a result, they have liberated countless hours of previously unproductive time for executives and employees, fueling innovation and accelerating profitable growth."
w,"As Millennials, and next in line the iGen, begin to take over the workforce, they are bringing with them leadership trends that will shape the future of organizational leadership. Modern organizations must respond to an increased pace of the workplace, and the nature of executives' tasks is increasingly complex. Despite the evidence suggesting that focusing on growth versus performance will lead to better long-term performance, our business schools continue to emphasize managing performance instead of leading growth. Trends such as real-time feedback, agile networks of teams, advanced people analytics, micro-learning, personalized learning, and artificial intelligence enable the digitally minded leader to shape the future of leadership. We know that many leadership dimensions have a causal relationship with desirable organizational outcomes, and that the foundational pillars of leadership, such as shared values and vision, talent development, change management, and reward and recognition, will likely continue to drive these outcomes. However, how we lead in these areas is changing. The current paper explored these phenomena based on current literature with an eye toward the future."
w,"Understanding how talent is attracted to companies and organizations is relevant. Additionally, it is critical to understand what keeps talent in organizations, something that Human Resource Management professionals have regularly debated over the past two decades. People, especially the younger and better prepared, change jobs today in a much more dynamic way than in the past, forcing organizations to face global competition, through strategies to maintain the high satisfaction of their teams and anticipate the intention talent output. The technology sector is one of the most targeted: the turnover of people is higher than in most sectors. This article seeks to understand how data analysis can help Human Resources Managers to perform their work better, either by knowing their teams or using people analytics to predict the change in their teams. It is hoped that this work will be a contribution to FIRM and technology professionals, two areas in which it is essential that they dialogue in order to promote a better and more effective functioning of teams, whatever the sector is."
w,"The wealth of organizations is being determined by the amount of quality data they possess. Organizations across the globe have recognised this phenomenon. With abundance of data along with advanced analytic tools and technologies, many organizations have embraced business analytics into their essential strategic and operational decision-making tools. Heart of business analytics is the data. The quality and value of decision-making outcomes lie with the data inputs supplied. Big data and social media analytics have given impetus to the expansion of business analytics into all critical functional areas of the organization. Though a little late, the domain of HR has also caught up the trend of applying analytics. This new area is termed as people analytics or HR analytics. In this paper, an attempt is made to understand the extent of data availability and usage in analytics, termed as data sophistication in HR analytics in the organizations. As there are no definite ways to determine the data sophistication levels, a response sheet with a set of 20 items is developed based on previous literature. Data is collected from HR professionals. This data is subjected to exploratory factor analysis to capture the important dimensions from the items. Using structural equation modelling, confirmatory factor analysis was carried out to assess the model fit. Based on the resultant model, data is subjected to ridit analysis to interpret the treatment effect intuitively. The findings of the study add to the field of study in the area of data analytics, HR analytics, and decision-making domains. New approaches and study opportunities in related areas can be explored in this area due to its fast-emerging nature."

Notable differences of people movement among sites are also discovered in the visual analytics.
w,"Introduction: The Alliance for Healthier Communities represents community-governed healthcare organizations in Ontario, Canada including Community Health Centres, which provide primary care to more disadvantaged populations. Methods: In this experience report, we describe the Alliance's journey towards becoming a learning health system using examples for organizational culture, data and analytics, people and partnerships, client engagement, ethics and oversight, evaluation and dissemination, resources, identification and prioritization, and deliverables and impact. Results: Many of the foundational elements for a learning health system were already in place at the Alliance including an integrated and accessible data platform. Leadership championed and embraced the movement towards a learning health system, which led to restructuring of the organization. This included role changes for data support personnel, better communication, and dissemination plans, strategies to engage clinicians and other front-line staff, restructuring of committees for more collaborative planning and prioritization of quality improvement and research initiatives, and the development of a new Practice-Based Learning Network for more opportunities to use the data for research and evaluation. Conclusions: Next steps will focus on continued clinical engagement and partnerships as well as ongoing reflection on the transition and success of the learning health system work."
w,"Many of the problems being addressed by Immersive Analytics require groups of people to solve. This chapter introduces the concept of Collaborative Immersive Analytics (CIA) and reviews how immersive technologies can be combined with Visual Analytics to facilitate co-located and remote collaboration. We provide a definition of Collaborative Immersive Analytics and then an overview of the different types of possible collaboration. The chapter also discusses the various roles in collaborative systems, and how to support shared interaction with the data being presented. Finally, we summarize the opportunities for future research in this domain. The aim of the chapter is to provide enough of an introduction to CIA and key directions for future research, so that practitioners will be able to begin working in the field."
w,"High-performing knowledge workers often question whether managers actually contribute much, especially in a technical environment. Until recently, that was the case at Google, a company filled with self-starters who viewed management as more destructive than beneficial and as a distraction from real work. But when Google's people analytics team examined the value of managers, applying the same rigorous research methods the company uses in its operations, it proved the skeptics wrong. Mining data from employee surveys, performance reviews, and double-blind interviews, the team verified that managers indeed had a positive impact. It also pinpointed exactly how, identifying the eight key behaviors of great Google managers. In this article, Harvard Business School professor Garvin describes how Google has incorporated the detailed findings from the research into highly specific, concrete guidelines; classes; and feedback reports that help managers hone their essential skills. Because these tools were built from the ground up, using the staff's own input, they've been embraced by Google employees. Managers say that they've found their training to be invaluable, and managers' ratings from direct reports have steadily risen across the company."
w,"In modern manufacturing environments, new technologies are introduced that bring machines, analytics and people closer together. As a consequence, a rise in productivity, flexibility and efficiency is expected. However, these technologies raise new privacy concerns as well. We look at AssiEff, a tool to reduce the energy consumption of production systems, analyse its privacy issues and requirements regarding authentication and propose two approaches in order to address these issues. The first approach is based on anonymous credentials; the second follows an organisational approach. Both approaches are evaluated in regards to security-, privacy- and economic-aspects. In the end, we draw the conclusion that although anonymous credentials fulfil all security and privacy requirements, the organisational approach is the more appropriate solution in most scenarios. Costs are low and the privacy of the employees is protected sufficiently."
w,"At the intersection of technology and marketing, this study develops a framework to unobtrusively detect salespeople's faces and simultaneously extract six emotions: happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, and disgust. The authors analyze 99,451 sales pitches on a livestream retailing platform and match them with actual sales transactions. Results reveal that each emotional display, including happiness, uniformly exhibits a negative U-shaped effect on sales over time. The maximum sales resistance appears in the middle rather than at the beginning or end of sales pitches. Taken together, the results show that in one-to-many screen-mediated communications, salespeople should sell with a straight face. In addition, the authors derive closed-form formulae for the optimal allocation of the presence of a face and emotional displays over the presentation span. In contrast to the U-shaped effects, the optimal face presence wanes at the start, gradually builds to a crescendo, and eventually ebbs. Finally, the study shows how to objectively rank salespeople and circumvent biases in performance appraisals, thereby making novel contributions to people analytics. This research integrates new types of data and methods, key theoretical insights, and important managerial implications to inform the expanding opportunity that livestream e-commerce presents to marketers to create, communicate, deliver, and capture value."
w,"Proper work with quantitative data is important for each segment of a company including Human Resource Management. People analytics represents a data driven approach to HRM and implementation of quantitative models in decision processing about company's workforce planning. Absenteeism is becoming an issue with high importance for all production companies. High costs following increasing absenteeism connected with decreased production or increased overtime work are at stake, and companies feel the necessity to set action steps and try to deal with it. This work aims to present the analysis of sick leave absenteeism based on information from five production companies with almost four thousand employees in total during 2016 and ways of managing and dealing with sick leave absenteeism. Focus groups are determined and their approach to absenteeism is discussed as well as HRM approach to this problem. Furtherly the analysis based on Bradford factor score is proposed. Bradford factor score represents a managerial tool to evaluate individuals according to the total length of their absenteeism and frequency of their absenteeism events. Rules and ways of possible active use of Bradford factor score analysis to manage the level of absenteeism are described and active action steps of HRM policies are discussed."
w,"Performance assessment is ubiquitous and crucial in people analytics. Scientific impact, particularly, plays a significant role in the academia. This paper attempts to understand researchers' career trajectories by considering the research community as a social network, where individuals build ties with each other via coauthorship. The resulting linkage facilitates information flow and affects researchers' future impact. Consequently, we systematically investigate the career trajectories of researchers with respect to research impact using the social capital theory as our theoretical foundation. Specifically, for early-stage and mid-career academics, we find that connections with prominent researchers associate with greater impact. Brokerage positions, in addition, are beneficial to a researcher's research impact in the long run. For senior researchers, however, the only social network feature that significantly affects their future impact is the reputation of their recently built ties. Finally, we build predictive models on future research impact which can be leveraged by both organizations and individuals. This paper provides empirical evidence for how social networks provide signals on researchers' career dynamics guided by social capital theory. Our findings have implications for individual researchers to strategically plan and promote their careers and for research institutions to better evaluate current as well as prospective employees."
w,"Reports about the appearance of unidentified flying objects became in the 20th century not only a constant of press texts, but also the basis for interpretations and speculations that swing between the alarmist scepticism and the ecstatic optimism. We do not know with certainty whether it is a physical or psychological phenomenon. From the perspective of Jungian analytics, people have been insisting on the thesis that implies that we arc witnessing a process of projection of unconscious archetypal structures. This idea is not opposed to the possibility of existence of a physical, real basis, but it insists on the connection between such a basis and the unconscious projective collective dynamics. You can start, therefore, from a perception of a real physical phenomenon so as archetypal structures to be triggered and later designed as the image of a complex global phenomenon, a phenomenon whose image is distorted by the modem mobility of the rumour. Thus, in the present work, we Will expose how Jung chose to respond to this issue arousing interest in post-modernity, even more so as the dilemma is not solved, the query is still lacking a clear answer and Jung, although he provides his own interpretative opinion, urges to a caution specific to analytical wisdom in thought and action."
w,"Does human reflexivity disappear as datafication and automation expand and machines take over decision making? In trying to find answers to this question, we take our lead from recent debates about People Analytics and analyze how the use of algorithmically driven digital technologies like facial recognition and drones in work-organizations and societies at large shape the conditions of ethical conduct. Linking the concepts of algorithmic governmentality and space of ethics, we analyze how such technologies come to form part of governing practices in specific contexts. We conclude that datafication and automation have huge implications for human reflexivity and the capacity to enact responsibility in decision making. But that itself does not mean that the space for ethical conduct disappears, which is the impression left in some literatures, but rather that is modified and (re) constituted in the interplay of mechanisms of closure (like automating decision making, black boxing and circumventing reflexivity), and opening (such as disclosing contingent values and interests in processes of problematization, contestation and resistance). We suggest that future research investigates in more detail the dynamics of closure and opening in empirical studies of the use and effects of algorithmically driven digital technologies in organizations and societies."
w,"The development of the startup market is a national and international reality; HR startups are included in this context, as a result of entrepreneurship and innovation practices. This research aims to analyze the action possibilities for people management startups in Brazil. To support the objective, we based the theoretical framework on the history and conceptualization of startups in general, as well as on the contextualization of HR startups and practices involving technology in HR. The chosen methodology was qualitative research, taking as a database a report carried out in 2019 by Liga Ventures, a Brazilian startup accelerator, which presented 274 human resources startups. The obtained results suggest that the main HR subsystems affected by the solutions offered by HR startups are Recruitment and Selection, Training and Development, Remuneration, and People Monitoring. The main resources related to these subsystems are People Analytics, which are targeting platforms for the audience of possible candidates that one may want to reach for the selection process; Employee Experience; Employer Branding; data intelligence; and gamification for training and remuneration, as well as software with performance evaluation for monitoring practices. In addition, the state of Sao Paulo loomed with the significant majority of these startups. As for size, those with 11 to 50 employees stood out. It was also found that most of the surveyed startups were founded over the past 3 and 4 years. This work contributes to highlighting the engagement of the human resources sector with technological resources through HR startups and shows that the solutions provided by them are already a reality and have great potential for development."
w,"As people continue to author and share increasing amounts of information in social media, the opportunity to leverage such information for relationship discovery tasks increases. In this paper, we describe a set of systems that mine, aggregate, and infer a social graph from social media inside an enterprise, resulting in over 73 million relationships between 450,000 people. We then describe SaNDVis, a novel visual analytics tool that supports people-centric tasks like expertise location, team building, and team coordination in the enterprise. We provide details of a 22-month-long, large-scale deployment to over 2,300 users from which we analyze longitudinal usage patterns, classify types of visual analytics queries and users, and extract dominant use cases from log and interview data. By integrating social position, evidence, and facets into SaNDVis, we demonstrate how users can use a visual analytics tool to reflect on existing relationships as well as build new relationships in an enterprise setting."
w,"Introduction: Health systems in high-income countries face a variety of challenges calling for a systemic approach to improve quality and efficiency. Putting people in the centre is the main idea of the WHO model of people-centred and integrated health services. Integrating health services is fuelled by an integration of health data with great potentials for decision support based on big data analytics. The research question of this paper is How can big data analytics support people-centred and integrated health services? Methods: A scoping review following the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses - Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) statement was conducted to gather information on how big data analytics can support people-centred and integrated health services. The results were summarized in a role model of a people-centred and integrated health services platform illustrating which data sources might be integrated and which types of analytics might be applied to support the strategies of the people-centred and integrated health services framework to become more integrated across the continuum of care. Additional rapid literature reviews were conducted to generate frequency distributions of the most often used data types and analytical methods in the medical literature. Finally, the main challenges connected with big data analytics were worked out based on a content analysis of the results from the scoping literature review. Results: Based on the results from the rapid literature reviews the most often used data sources for big data analytics (BDA) in healthcare were biomarkers (39.3%) and medical images (30.9%). The most often used analytical models were support vector machines (27.3%) and neural networks (20.4%). The people-centred and integrated health services framework defines different strategic interventions for health services to become more integrated. To support all aspects of these interventions a comparably integrated platform of health-related data would be needed, so that a role model labelled as people-centred health platform was developed. Based on integrated data the results of the scoping review (n = 72) indicate, that big data analytics could for example support the strategic intervention of tailoring personalized health plans (43.1%), e.g. by predicting individual risk factors for different therapy options. Also BDA might enhance clinical decision support tools (31.9%), e.g. by calculating risk factors for disease uptake or progression. BDA might also assist in designing population-based services (26.4% by clustering comparable individuals in manageable risk groups e.g. mentored by specifically trained, non-medical professionals. The main challenges of big data analytics in healthcare were categorized in regulatory, (information-) technological, methodological, and cultural issues, whereas methodological challenges were mentioned most often (55.0%), followed by regulatory challenges (43.7%). Discussion: The BDA applications presented in this literature review are based on findings which have already been published. For some important components of the framework on people-centred care like enhancing the role of community care or establishing intersectoral partnerships between health and social care institutions only few examples of enabling big data analytical tools were found in the literature. Quite the opposite does this mean that these strategies have less potential value, but rather that the source systems in these fields need to be further developed to be suitable for big data analytics. Conclusions: Big data analytics can support people-centred and integrated health services e.g. by patient similarity stratifications or predictions of individual risk factors. But BDA fails to unfold its full potential until data source systems are still disconnected and actions towards a comprehensive and people-centred health-related data platform are politically insufficiently incentivized. This work highlighted the potential of big data analysis in the context of the model of people-centred and integrated health services, whereby the role model of the person-centered health platform can be used as a blueprint to support strategies to improve personcentered health care. Likely because health data is extremely sensitive and complex, there are only few practical examples of platforms to some extent already capable of merging and processing people-centred big data, but the integration of health data can be expected to further proceed so that analytical opportunities might also become reality in the near future."

Internet-of-things (IoT) offers a great potential for workplace gains using the quantified self and the computer vision strategies. Their goal is to focus on productivity, fitness, wellness, and improvement of the work environment. Recognizing and regulating human emotion is vital to people analytics as it plays an important role in workplace productivity. Within the smart industry setting, various non-invasive IoT devices can be used to recognize emotions and study the behavioral outcomes in various situations. This research puts forward a deep learning model for detection of human emotional state in real-time using multimodal data from the Emotional Internet-of-things (E-IoT). The proposed multimodal emotion recognition model, MEmoR makes use of two data modalities: visual and psychophysiological. The video signals are sampled to obtain image frames and a ResNet50 model pre-trained for face recognition is fine-tuned for emotion classification. Simultaneously, CNN is trained on the psychophysiological signals and the results of the two modality networks are combined using decision-level weighted fusion. The model is tested on the benchmark Bio Vid Emo DB multi modal dataset and compared to the state-of-the-art. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The cost of treatment increases significantly in people with diabetes and treatment may result in lower extremities amputations (LEAs). The Visual Analytics, Correction in Foot Care Hardness can help in early detection of people at risk of Foot Ulcer. The paper finds out the average hardness of male and female foot wears in Indian population. With help of visual analytics paper tries to find out the prevalence of people at risk of foot ulcer in diabetes. The paper also explores whether the risk of foot ulcer is significantly higher for a specific gender. The methods used for analysis is t-test and Chi-Square test."
w,"Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are the most fundamental resources used in healthcare data analytics. Since people visit hospital more frequently when they feel sick and doctors prescribe lab examinations when they feel necessary, we argue that there could be a strong bias in EMR observations compared with the hidden conditions of patients. Directly using such EMR for analytical tasks without considering the bias may lead to misinterpretation. To this end, we propose a general method to resolve the bias by transforming EMR to regular patient hidden condition series using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) variant. Compared with the biased EMR series with irregular time stamps, the unbiased regular time series is much easier to be processed by most analytical models and yields better results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our bias resolving method imputes missing data more accurately than baselines and improves the performance of the state-of-the-art methods on typical medical data analytics."
w,"People tracking is a crucial task in most computer vision applications aimed at analyzing specific behaviors in the sensed area. Practical applications include vision analytics, people counting, etc. In order to properly follow the actions of a single subject, a people tracking framework needs to robustly recognize it from the rest of the surrounding environment, thus allowing proper management of changing positions, occlusions and so on. The recent widespread diffusion of deep learning techniques on almost any kind of computer vision application provides a powerful methodology to address recognition. On the other hand, a large amount of data is required to train state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and this problem is solved, when possible, by means of transfer learning. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset made of nearly 26 thousand samples acquired with a custom stereo camera providing depth according to a fast and accurate stereo algorithm. The dataset includes sequences acquired in different environments with more than 20 different people moving across the sensed area. Once labeled the 26 K images and depth maps of the dataset, we train a head detection module based on state-of-the-art deep network on a portion of the dataset and validate it a different sequence. Finally, we include the head detection module within an existing 3D tracking framework showing that the proposed approach notably improves people detection and tracking accuracy."
w,"Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) has led to rapidly changing the business environment. Integration of AI in human resource will facilitate the analysing, predicting and diagnosing of the issues faced by the organizations and help to make better employee related decisions. An integrative synthesis of multiple streams of literature was undertaken to critically analyze the implementation of AI and HR analytics in HRM for performance enhancement and to gain a competitive advantage. The HRM has undergone a drastic transformation from the administrative functionality to more advanced processes like automation through application of artificial intelligence which has entirely re-defined and re-shaped the attributes of the organizational workforce. AI plays a major role within HR to support smart people analytics. With deployment of AI and analytics in HR functions such as talent acquisition, training and development, employee retention, employee engagement and performance appraisal, organizations can enhance proficiency and productivity. Additionally, AI, cloud and HR Analytics also support in collecting huge volumes of employee information. HR is considered as a 'predictive engine' essential for the organizational upliftment. The real challenge for HR department is how thoroughly they can enhance employee skills and rerenovate their teams in the field of HR Analytics and AL The current research evaluates the functional analysis of artificial intelligence in the human resource context. It emphasizes on the application of AI in various HRM functions and stipulates the barriers in adoption of HR technological among employees."

w,"Advertisement (hereby referred as 'ad') blockers are a continuous emerging threat to Digital Content Writers. While most of the creators prefer to keep the content free by allowing ads, these Ad blockers are causing harm. They are useful to block Spam ads but without any means of segregation between good or had, it is prone to block Advertisements. This paper focuses on how the Business analysis could he employed to construct a strategy that companies that display written content like e-newspapers & e-magazines could employ to deal with the threat posed by Advertisement blocking software. The problem statement is explained in four phases of Business Analytics: Operations Analytics studied the models that predict the effect of the Ad-blockers on the organization; Customer Analytics guided the research by predicting the customer behaviour, marketing decisions, and Strategy. Accounting Analytics dealt with how the Ad-blockers affect the company's financial bottom line. Finally, People Analytics suggested the measures that strengthen the company's internal organization to deal with Ad-blockers. The main strategy to tackle this issue was taken from Wharton's Future of Advertising (WFoA) program's R.A.V.E.S.[1] that is an advertisement must he relevant and respectful, actionable, valuable and value generating with exceptional experience and share-worthy story from the end user. Alternative strategies like Enhancing the User Experience in the mobile application, collaborating and sharing knowledge articles with similar companies was also discussed. The anticipated effects of the proposed strategy were measured through various metrics that included customer satisfaction levels through paid apps, subscription fees, pay-per-click thoughts. Key drivers to the customer's chance of viewing the advertisement were discussed along with questions for measurement were answered thereby giving the entire Business Analytics Model implementation."
w,"PurposeThis research aims to explore whether or how organizations adopt people analytics (PA), its value and potential socio-technical factors that can enable or hinder PA projects by disrupting and reshaping human resource management. We do this by focusing on the Italian context.Design/methodology/approachWe conduct a scoping review of data collected between 2018 and 2022 via Google Alerts (GA), a content change detection and notification service that is gaining popularity in scholarly research.FindingsOur findings suggest that the diffusion of PA applications in Italy, especially those of a descriptive nature, is growing. Most of the existing PA applications are positioned in a positive technocratic light, envisioning the value of PA for both employees and organizations. The value for the latter appears to be direct, while the value for employees is realized through organizational initiatives. The findings also suggest that while enablers can vary between PA application types, the barriers, especially technological and environmental, are generic for both descriptive and predictive/prescriptive PA applications.Originality/valueTheoretically, we propose a framework for analyzing PA applications, their values, enablers and barriers. Methodologically, we present and describe in detail a novel approach, drawing on GA that can be used to study PA in specific contexts. Practically, our study serves as a helpful point of reference for managers planning or implementing PA in Italy, for benchmarking PA in Italy over time and for comparative international studies."

The method used in the research to measure the awareness was publishing both online and paper surveys. The surveys got a total of 208 participants, they come from different universities, and with different majors in the computer science field. The survey results show that 139 out of 208 people did know about IBM company and their knowledge about the company come from colleges and social media network, but not from the IBM website or its charity and community works, also the study show that few people know about IBM solutions where (Only 16 people know about IBM Bluemix and Only 14 people know about Watson Analytics)."
w,"As smart technologies pervade our everyday environments, they change what people should learn to live meaningfully as valuable participants of our society. For instance, ubiquitous availability of smart devices and communication networks may have reduced the burden for people to remember factual information. At the same time, they may have increased the benefits to master the uses of new digital technologies. In the midst of such a social and technological shift, we could design novel integrated platforms that support people at all ages to learn, work, collaborate, and co-create easily. In this paper, we discuss our ideas and first steps towards building an extended learning analytics platform that elderly people and unskilled adults can use. By understanding the characteristics and needs of elderly learners and addressing critical user interface issues, we can build pervasive and inclusive learning analytics platforms that trigger contextual reminders to support people at all ages to live and learn actively regardless of age-related differences of cognitive capabilities. We discuss that resolving critical usability problems for elderly people could open up a plethora of opportunities for them to search and exploit vast amount of information to achieve various goals."
w,"Purpose This paper aims to explore predicting employee learning activity via employee characteristics and usage for two online learning tools. Design/methodology/approach Statistical analysis focused on observational data collected from user logs. Data are analyzed via regression models. Findings Findings are presented for over 40,000 employees' learning activity for one year in a multinational technology company. Variables including job level and tool use yielded a predictive model for overall learning behaviors. In addition, relevant differences are found for managers and nonprofessional learning. Research limitations/implications Importantly, how well employees learned content was not measured. This research is also limited to observational relationships: for example, the online tools were used by self-selected users, instead of randomly assigned. Future research which randomly assigns tool use to employee subgroups could explore causal relationships. Practical implications This paper presents implications for business analysts and educational technology: how predictive analytics can leverage data to plan programs, the significant challenges for the adoption and usage for online learning tools, and the distinct needs of managers engaging with these tools. Originality/value Given a growing emphasis on using employee data, it is important to explore how learning behaviors can be made visible in people analytics. While previous research has surveyed employee cultures on learning or explored the socio-psychological factors which contribute to this learning, this paper presents novel data on employee participation in learning programs which illuminates both how HR metrics can productively use this data to reify learning patterns, and how workplace technology designers can consider important factors such as internal hierarchies."

w,"Healthcare informatics emphasizes on the gathering, processing, assessment, and utilization of health records, information, and expertise. By connecting genetics, proteomics, and patient records, bioinformatics uses computational methods and tools to research and analyze huge biological datasets, completely understand illness, and grasp genetics and proteomics. Interpreting genomic and proteomic data for basic biological research, as well as for use in healthcare, drug discovery, and related fields, is the main focus. Large amounts of electronic data collection in the healthcare industry lead to the development of analytics. Data analytics is adept at enhancing healthcare, cutting costs, and preserving people. The explosion of data leads to the use of data analytics in the healthcare industry to explore understandings and make smart judgments. In order to create a better health service, this paper focuses on bioinformatics, healthcare informatics, and analytics. It examines the advantages, how each one helps to improve the health service, how bioinformatics, health informatics, and analytics connect, and lastly, what the coming times holds for healthcare informatics as well as analytics."
w,"The Internet of Things anticipates the conjunction of physical gadgets to the Internet and their access to wireless sensor data which makes it expedient to restrain the physical world. Big Data convergence has put multifarious new opportunities ahead of business ventures to get into a new market or enhance their operations in the current market. considering the existing techniques and technologies, it is probably safe to say that the best solution is to use big data tools to provide an analytical solution to the Internet of Things. Based on the current technology deployment and adoption trends, it is envisioned that the Internet of Things is the technology of the future; while to-day's real-world devices can provide real and valuable analytics, and people in the real world use many IoT devices. Despite all the advertisements that companies offer in connection with the Internet of Things, you as a liable consumer, have the right to be suspicious about IoT advertisements. The primary question is: What is the promise of the Internet of things concerning reality and what are the prospects for the future."
w,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to highlight the importance of the ethical investigation of the emerging practice of people analytics (PA) within human resource (HR) management through charting the development of PA before during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach This paper is designed as a short review of the current thinking in the ethics of PA, a practical journey through the progression of PA across the pandemic and a theoretical exploration of PA through three lenses: virtue ethics, critical social theory and actor network theory. Findings The authors suggest that PA raises novel ethical issues in terms of personal impact, increased penetration into working and home lives and the punch delivered in terms of organisational and behavioural change. Research limitations/implications This study provides a short review of three theoretical approaches to PA. Detailed research and reflection is required to develop and extend an ethics of PA. While engagement with the ethics of PA requires gaining an understanding of the discipline, ideas and jargon of HR management, it is essential that ethicists engage with PA as HR departments take on greater influence and adopt executive roles. Practical implications PA is now at the top of the HR management agenda, but there is limited understanding of the technology, the ethics and the new responsibilities it brings for HR management. This paper raises the profile of an ethical agenda, which practitioners should engage with. Social implications The ethical consequences of PA have social implications as work practices change and hybrid working becomes prevalent. It has the potential to change the relationship between home and the workplace. Originality/value This paper provides a unique synthesis of theory and practice in a new area of ethical importance."
w,"Purpose This research analyzed the existing academic and grey literature concerning the technologies and practices of people analytics (PA), to understand how ethical considerations are being discussed by researchers, industry experts and practitioners, and to identify gaps, priorities and recommendations for ethical practice. Design/methodology/approach An iterative scoping review method was used to capture and synthesize relevant academic and grey literature. This is suited to emerging areas of innovation where formal research lags behind evidence from professional or technical sources. Findings Although the grey literature contains a growing stream of publications aimed at helping PA practitioners to be ethical, overall, research on ethical issues in PA is still at an early stage. Optimistic and technocentric perspectives dominate the PA discourse, although key themes seen in the wider literature on digital/data ethics are also evident. Risks and recommendations for PA projects concerned transparency and diverse stakeholder inclusion, respecting privacy rights, fair and proportionate use of data, fostering a systemic culture of ethical practice, delivering benefits for employees, including ethical outcomes in business models, ensuring legal compliance and using ethical charters. Research limitations/implications This research adds to current debates over the future of work and employment in a digitized, algorithm-driven society. Practical implications The research provides an accessible summary of the risks, opportunities, trade-offs and regulatory issues for PA, as well as a framework for integrating ethical strategies and practices. Originality/value By using a scoping methodology to surface and analyze diverse literatures, this study fills a gap in existing knowledge on ethical aspects of PA. The findings can inform future academic research, organizations using or considering PA products, professional associations developing relevant guidelines and policymakers adapting regulations. It is also timely, given the increase in digital monitoring of employees working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic."
w,"This paper explores the feasibility in using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) night light data as a proxy for approximation of socio-economic indicators like poverty rate and income inequality. The feasibility is assessed by testing if features of night light data correlate to: 1) the rate of poverty and 2) income inequality. The poverty rate is derived from Thai People Map and Analytics Platform (TPMAP), a project initiated by the Thai government with the goal of developing a data analytics platform for precision poverty alleviation by enabling policy-makers to identify the poor, locate them, and understand their basic needs. The poverty rate from TPMAP is computed using Multidimensional Poverty Index and income inequality statistics are calculated using data from three disparate sources. These two measures are used as the target of this study. We show night light data features that have high correlations with monetary based income features and moderate correlations with poverty rate at the province level of Thailand."
w,"Davenport [5] argues that the most important component for putting big data into action within an organization is talent management, and this opinion is widely shared among academics. We interviewed the chief purchasing officers (CPOs) of 15 major corporations and found that they did not feel it was problematic to find the right people for data analytics teams, and did not feel it was difficult to get resources to support data analytics efforts. Instead, they were frustrated by data issues such as granularity, accuracy, and integration. They also were intimidated by what they perceived to be the requirements for prescriptive analytics, and generally had not progressed beyond descriptive analytics. This article summarizes the roadblocks that the CPOs encountered as they attempted to move from descriptive to predictive to prescriptive analytics, and presents a set of steps which must be followed if organizations are to move up the analytics hierarchy."
w,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the evolution of the concept of human resource analytics (HRA) and propose an operational framework demonstrating the sources generating data for HRA, as well as the impact of HRA on multiple levels in the organization. Design/methodology/approach A review of literature was conducted to present the existing body of knowledge and build upon for the development of an operational framework for successful implementation of HRA as a human resources (HR) process. Findings Building upon the existing literature, this paper presents an operational HRA framework, positioning HRA as an analytical process through integrating advanced statistical methodology. HRA presents a tool to obtain evidence-based analytical results for improving people-related performance, operational effectiveness, and ultimately the impact of the business strategy. By using HR big data, HRA impacts multiple organizational levels, from individual employees to HR functions and the organizational strategy. Practical implications While research on data analytics has recently flourished across various management fields, this has not been the case for the broader field of HR. This is especially a growing concern as the lack of understanding of the basics and fundamentals of people analytics in the field of HR may delay the effective implementation and operationalization of HRA and present additional barriers impacting on-going HR activities, as well as HR's role as a strategic business partner. HR practice may greatly benefit from gaining an understanding of HRA and the multi-levels of impact it may have on the organization. Originality/value This paper explores various concepts related to HRA by examining terms such as HR metrics vs HR and HR big data vs big data. Furthermore, the comprehensive HRA operational framework presented in this paper provides HR professionals and researchers with a better understanding of HRA in the age of data analytics and artificial intelligence."
w,"The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is able to connect machines, analytics and people with IoT smart devices, gateway nodes and edge devices to create powerful intuitivenesses to drive smarter, faster and effective business agreements. IIoT having interconnected machines along with devices can monitor, gather, exchange, and analyze information. Since the communication among the entities in IIoT environment takes place insecurely (for instance, wireless communications and Internet), an intruder can easily tamper with the data. Moreover, physical theft of IoT smart devices provides an intruder to mount impersonation and other attacks. To handle such critical issues, in this work, we design a new private blockchain-envisioned access control scheme for Pervasive Edge Computing (PEC) in IIoT environment, called PBACS-PECIIoT. We consider the private blockchain consisting of the transactions and registration credentials of the entities related to IIoT, because the information is strictly confidential and private. The security of PBACS-PECIIoT is significantly improved due to usage of blockchain as immutability, transparency and decentralization along with protection of various potential attacks. A meticulous comparative analysis exhibits that PBACS-PECIIoT achieves greater security and more functionality features, and requires low costs for communication and computational as compared to other pertinent schemes."
w,"The existing literature on street vendors has largely examined processes of marginalisation of informal enterprises amid rapid urban development. At the same time, the resistance methods of street vendors against the constraints of urban development have been extensively explored. However, these studies tend to focus on the binary position between informal and formal, as well as on the overt confrontation and conflicts between vendors and the state, which risks simplifying the heterogeneity of interests in the everyday practice of street vending. Delving into the daily work of street vendors in Bandung city, this article explores the everyday practice of traders in order to identify their subtle forms of resistance to removal and to the negative perceptions attached to them. By adopting the analytics of 'people as infrastructure' (Simone, 2004) and the idea of 'building blocks of success' for small enterprises (Turner, 2003), this article argues that social infrastructure is constituted and practiced through the construction of personal relationships and varied forms of informal economic exchange between vendors and their customers, informal organisers and neighbours, as well as through the adoption of new technology. Social infrastructures have become a means of building everyday politics for street vendors and a vital way of challenging the negative perception attached to street vending activities."
w,"Smart Donations is a blockchain-based platform that offers users 'contracts' that donate funds to certain causes in response to real-world events e.g., whenever an earthquake is detected or an activist tweets about refugees. We designed Smart donations with Oxfam Australia, trialled it for 8-weeks with 86 people, recorded platform analytics and qualitatively analysed questionnaires and interviews about user experiences. Temporal qualities emerge when automation enforces conditions that contributed to participants' awareness of events that are usually unconscious, and senses of immediacy in contributing to crisis response and ongoing involvement in situations far-away while awaiting conditions to be met. We suggest data driven automation can reveal diverse temporal registers, in real-world phenomena, sociality, morality and everyday life, which contributes to experiencing a 'right time' to donate that is not limited to productivity or efficiency. Thus, we recommend a sensitivity to right time in designing for multiple temporalities in FinTech more generally."
w,"Most businesses today have started utilizing innovative informational technologies such as digital marketing, fin-tech, digital human resources management and business analytics. Educating people on these new skills presents a business opportunity for educational technology (edtech) companies. Many technology-enhanced learning (TEL)-based business education programmes are being developed recently, promising to enhance professional skills and knowledge. The marketing information surrounding these programmes overloads learners' minds and makes it impossible to determine which programmes are worth their time and money. Such learning solutions are developed using competency-based education (CBE) frameworks and by leveraging TEL environments. Moreover, the complexity of CBE-TEL-based interventions makes it difficult to evaluate their quality. The present study intends to overcome this challenge by identifying the qualitative factors that enhance professional competence in TEL environments. The study proposed a new model called 'Competence Based Technology Enabled Learning' (COBTEL), which has been empirically tested for its validity and reliability. The model is analysed using partial least squares algorithm-based structural equation modelling to evaluate TEL-based programmes' competence-enhancing aspects from the learners' perspective. In addition, the utilization of the COBTEL model would assist institutes, universities and governments in improving the quality of management education programmes."
w,"As wireless sensor network (WSN) technology advances, more practical applications become possible. One important application involves mobility analytics. Data concerning how people move in urban environments can inform city planners and businesses to support improved decision-making. Numerous studies have been conducted on pedestrian localization using the received signal strength index (RSSI) of mobile device WiFi probe requests. However, these studies were only conducted over the span of days. Since a real-world WSN requires long-term, reliable accuracy, further experimentation is required to determine whether accuracy is maintained over time. We evaluate the long-term viability of RSSI as a localization metric through an analysis of experimental results using a robotic testbed platform."
w,"Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected the economy and lifestyle of people. Various data analytics have been performed on data obtained from various sources. These analytics include symptom prediction, time -series forecasting, and impact analyses. Forecasting the end of the pandemic remains a challenge for many countries. Time -series forecasting models have been proposed for various applications. However, a nonseasonal and nonstationary forecasting method is required for predicting the progression of the pandemic. An auto regressive linear regression algorithm was proposed using the COVID-19 data of a certain geography. The results of the proposed methodology are convincing when compared with the nonseasonal and nonstationary existing methodologies, such as linear regression and exponential smoothing variants. The standard deviation and root mean square error of the proposed method were 430.22 and 0.31, respectively, for active cases, and 27.01 and 0.77 for the rate of transmission with positive skew and platykurtic trend, respectively."

w,"Marketing analytics (MA) is a relatively new but increasingly prominent field in which data tools are applied to quantify and monitor marketing performance and customer information to optimize investments in marketing programs and maximize customer interaction. MA is a sub-discipline of broader analytics and includes the people, processes, and technology to generate insights that improve marketing performance. In this B2B study, the authors established an initial set of factors, with the help of deep subject matter experts in the field, which help determine the degree to which a firm's marketing function is analytically driven. The research builds on extant theories of market orientation and lays the foundation for the development of a new construct known as marketing analytics orientation through qualitative research methods."
w,"Both analyzing mobility traces and understanding a user's movement semantics from mobile sensor data are challenging issues in ubiquitous computing systems. With the pervasiveness of sensor technologies, wireless networks and GPS-equipped devices, a huge volume of location information is being accumulated. Several techniques have been proposed to analyze the mobility traces and extract informative knowledge for varied location-aware applications. However, all of these applications necessitate an effective mobility-analysis framework to capture the movement behavior of individuals in minimum delay. This paper aims to develop a cloud-based mobility analytics framework to model peoples' mobility behaviour in varied granular scale and extract usable knowledge to provision location-aware services. The preliminary experimental results on real-life dataset depict the effectiveness of our proposed framework."

This work describes the significance of each of the eight datasets and their associated challenge questions. The challenge questions for each dataset were required to cover multiple difficulty levels. An international call for participation was sent to students, asking them to form teams of up to six people and apply novel data analytics and edge computing methods to solve these challenges."
w,"This paper introduces Trellis - a low-cost Wi-Fi-based in vehicle monitoring and tracking system that can passively observe mobile devices and provide various analytics about people both within and outside a vehicle which can lead to interesting population insights at a city scale. Our system runs on a vehicle-based edge computing platform and is a complementary mechanism which allows operators to collect various information, such as original-destination stations popular among passengers, occupancy of vehicles, pedestrian activity trends, and more. To conduct most of our analytics, we develop simple but effective algorithms that determine which device is actually inside (or outside) of a vehicle by leveraging some contextual information. While our current system does not provide accurate actual numbers of passengers and pedestrians, we expect the relative numbers and general trends to be fairly useful from an analytics perspective. We have deployed Trellis on a vehicle-based edge computing platform over a period of ten months, and have collected more than 30,000 miles of travel data spanning multiple bus routes. By combining our techniques, with bus schedule and weather information, we present a varied human mobility analysis across multiple aspects - activity trends of passengers in transit systems; trends of pedestrians on city streets; and how external factors, e.g., temperature and weather, impact human outdoor activities. These observations demonstrate the usefulness of Trellis in proposed settings."
w,"A UN report states that in 2050, about 70% of the total world population will live in cities. This increases the complexity of the services that the local public administrations have to provide the citizens with to keep an acceptable level of quality of life. For an appropriate design, deployment and management of these services, there is the need for tools to extract data on how the people move, which activities they conduct out and their behaviour (in an anonymous way). This need has justified extensive efforts towards the design of effective solutions for extracting this information. In this work, we present the People Mobility Analytics (PmA) solution, which collects probe requests generated by Wi-Fi devices when scanning the radio channels to detect Access Points. The PmA system processes the collected data to extract key insights on the people mobility, such as: crowd density per area of interest, people flows, time of permanence, time of return, heat maps, origin-destination matrices and estimation of people positions. The major novelty with respect to the state of the art is related to new powerful indicators that are needed for some key city services, such as security management and people transport services, and the experimental activities carried out in real scenarios.

w,"The significance of big data advancement has benefited various organizations to leverage the potential insights and capabilities of big data in organizational performance and decision-making. However, the analytics outcome and quality of big data analytics (BDA) implementation has yet to be addressed. Therefore the aims of this paper are to identify and analyze the affecting factors and elements of BDA implementation and to propose a conceptual model for effective decision-making through BDA implementation assessment. The model is developed based on three dimensions such as performing data strategy (organization), collaborative knowledge worker (people) and executing data analytics (technology). The findings of this ongoing study proceeds with designing a proposed conceptual model with the research hypothesis and may provide a better assessment model for effective decision-making in the long run."
w,"Big data analytics employs algorithms to uncover people's preferences and values, and support their decision making. A central assumption of big data analytics is that it can explain and predict human behavior. We investigate this assumption, aiming to enhance the knowledge basis for developing algorithmic standards in big data analytics. First, we argue that big data analytics is by design atheoretical and does not provide process-based explanations of human behavior; thus, it is unfit to support deliberation that is transparent and explainable. Second, we review evidence from interdisciplinary decision science, showing that the accuracy of complex algorithms used in big data analytics for predicting human behavior is not consistently higher than that of simple rules of thumb. Rather, it is lower in situations such as predicting election outcomes, criminal profiling, and granting bail. Big data algorithms can be considered as candidate models for explaining, predicting, and supporting human decision making when they match, in transparency and accuracy, simple, process-based, domain-grounded theories of human behavior. Big data analytics can be inspired by behavioral and cognitive theory."
w,"Despite the advancement that has been seen in all life aspects and in particular in technology, patients still struggle in receiving the care and emergent support they need due to the ever-increasing cost of healthcare services and the increasing number of chronic diseases patients. Information technology can offer promising solutions to 21'st century human, in particularly what is called internet of things (IoTs) and remote based services. We design and develop a solution where patients can use wearable sensors that can offer a prediction and alerting in their heart disease conditions. The solution seems promising when it is combined with medical profile data, better decisions can be made and alerting of emergency can be timely which can help to save lives. We use data gathered from few people to build our analytics and decision model."
w,"Recent research has developed analytics that threaten online self-presentation and privacy by automatically generating profiles of individuals' most personal traits-their personality, values, motivations, and so on. But we know little about people's reactions to personal traits profiles of themselves, or what influences their decisions to share such profiles. We present an early qualitative study of people's reactions to a working hyper-personal analytics system. The system lets them see their personality and values profile derived from their own social media text. Our results reveal a paradox. Participants found their personal traits profiles creepily accurate and did not like sharing them in many situations. However, they felt pressured by the social risks of not sharing and showed signs of learned helplessness, leading them to share despite their misgivings. Further, they felt unqualified to significantly modify their profile contents due to a surprising trust in the expert algorithm. We explore design implications for hyper-personal analytics systems that consider the needs and preferences of the people being profiled, suggesting ways to enhance the control they feel and the benefits they reap."
w,"The COVID-19 pandemic has suddenly raised the need for technological solutions able to trace contacts of people and provide location-based analytics. Several countries have adopted proximity-based (short-range) technologies, such as Bluetooth, which, however, appear to be hindered by deployment issues, security leakage, lack of reliability, and data governance concerns. This article posits that 5G and beyond can play a primary role in contact tracing and group movement monitoring. Contact tracing based on 5G location-based analytics benefits from the pervasive deployment of cellular networks, the several years of effort to design cellular standards for localization and analytics, and the best practices of cellular operators to handle location data."
w,"Purpose - The metaverse, through artificial intelligence (AI) systems and capabilities, allows considerable data analysis in the workplace, largely exceeding traditional people analytics data collection. While concerns over surveillance and issues associated with privacy and discrimination have been raised, the metaverse has the potential to offer opportunities associated with fairer assessment of employee performance and enhancement of the employee experience, especially with respect to gender and race, inclusiveness and workplace equity. This paper aims at shedding light on the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) opportunities and challenges of implementing the metaverse in the workplace, and the role played by AI. Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on our past research on AI and the metaverse and provides insights addressed to human resources (HR) scholars and practitioners. Findings - Our analysis of AI applications to the metaverse in the workplace sheds light on the ambivalent role of and potential trade-offs that may arise with this emerging technology. If used responsibly, the metaverse can enable positive changes concerning the future of work, which can promote DEI. Yet, the same technology can lead to negative DEI outcomes if implementations occur quickly, unsupervised and with a sole focus on efficiencies and productivity (i.e. collecting metrics, models etc.). Practical implications - Managers and HR leaders should try to be first movers rather than followers when deciding if (or, better, when) to implement metaverse capabilities in their organizations. But how the metaverse is implemented will be strategic. This involves choices concerning the degree of invasive/pervasive monitoring (internal) as well as make or buy decisions concerning outsourcing AI capabilities. Originality/value - Our paper is one among few (to date) that discusses AI capabilities in the metaverse at the intersection of the HR and information systems(IS) literature and that specifically tackles DEI issues. Also, we take a balanced approach when evaluating the metaverse from a DEI perspective. While most studies either demonize or celebrate these technologies from an ethical and DEI standpoint, we aim to highlight challenges and opportunities, with the goal to guide scholars and practitioners towards a responsible use of the metaverse in organizations."
w,"We are witnessing a radical change of attitude towards health information management - the adoption of data analytics to help people monitor and predict health conditions proactively. Most hospitals are aggregating data to provide some sort of analytics as part of their daily practices. Many medical doctors start developing data repositories of their own specialty so that evidence-based clinical decisions can be made, and data of research value can be obtained and exploited efficiently. Health analytics projects need to have software requirements defined for them. These projects must deal with the data itself, the operations performed on the data, and the formatting and distribution of the data for use. The end products of requirements process for a health analytics project will be a set of business and user requirements (both functional, and nonfunctional). It reveals stakeholder needs of analytics results, in terms of how quickly, how often and in what format. This paper shares our observations on the status quo in this area, present the problems and challenges encountered, report the experience and findings in real world projects, and discuss some possible future directions in this area."
w,"Introduction: Forgetting shapes learning in two different ways. It impedes learning when important lessons are forgotten. Equally, it can be difficult to enact new lessons if we do not let go of old beliefs and practices that are no longer useful. A learning health system (LHS) that wishes to improve health service delivery will need to find ways to remember processes that shape quality and safety - using data that often resides beyond electronic health records. An LHS will also need to forget, or programmatically decommission, obsolete practices, whose persistence otherwise leads to unnecessary system complexity and inertia to change. Discussion: New forms of data needed to improve health services include process metrics extracted from digital systems; human-level metrics that capture workflow patterns and clinician behaviors; and multivariate process patterns that can identify service syndromes. To avoid inertia to change, system complexity must be reduced by retiring (or forgetting) inefficient or unhelpful work practices. Biological models of programmed cell death provide a rich set of mechanisms to decommission elements of health services. These models suggest health service elements should be able to detect the end of their useful life and should contain internal mechanisms to orchestrate decommissioning-in contrast to current service decommissioning, which is an externally initiated, top-down down-driven process. Conclusions: An LHS should take advantage of digital infrastructure to bring together people, sensors, analytics, and quasi-autonomous mechanisms for service adaptation. By drawing inspiration from biology, we can design LHSs that do not just remember but also actively forget."
w,"In 2009-2010, in Goroka, I studied card games that had a lineage traceable to a common ancestor called laki. Two games were dominant: kwin (queen) and bom (bomb). Both allowed players to test and act upon their efficacy, detect the disruptive negative thoughts of others, and cultivate the thoughts seen as essential to success. Yet the games' characters were contrasted: one was slow, the other fast; one is long-standing, the other a craze; one for the old, one for the young; one more Melanesian', one irresponsible. Kwin and bom are among a repertoire of indigenous analytics' used by people at different life-stages; they model Goroka because they propagate the types of thought they cater to, and fall victim to that thought in turn, e.g., fast games' propagate fast thoughts' that get bored with the games' rules and invent others to take their place. This speaks to Melanesian and anthropological preoccupations with effecting innovations within, and upon, total systems' like the famous kula or moka. In gambling this innovatory capacity is measured by speed, providing a ready model for broader change."
w,"Predictive analytics are changing the way people interact with technology, and therefore empirical studies on interaction processes between predictive analytics and users in the organizational context are needed. Drawing on Affordance Actualization Theory (AAT), this article addresses this gap by exploring how affordances of predictive analytics are actualized. Focusing on a French predictive policing system, it examines the affordanceuse-actualization process developed by police officers as they interact with the system to achieve professional goals. We conducted an in-depth empirical study, followed by qualitative content analysis of triangulated datasets (twelve interviews, focused observations and archival data) and a FsQCA survey of 69 effective users. After identifying two affordances and five uses, our findings lead to a configurational framework showing how affordances of the predictive policing system are actualized through patterns of uses. This article contributes to AAT by revealing two distinct attributes of patterns of uses: equifinality (multiple patterns of uses actualize the same affordance) and polyfinality (a single pattern of uses actualizes multiple affordances). It also shows the benefits of using FsQCA methods to investigate the affordance-pattern of uses-actualization process. Finally, this article encourages practitioners to navigate complex and unforeseen processes that emerge from open-ended interactions with predictive analytics."
w,"Adobe's Identity Graph allows enterprises to more effectively utilize their data in a digital marketing context. We enable enterprises to stitch together all known and anonymous identities of a user between logical and physical devices. This allows companies to perform marketing and analytics in the context of people rather than signals coming from different devices. As a result, a more holistic view of any given customer can be achieved. The graph is built through a combination of deterministic and probabilistic approaches which are applied to both online and offline data. The efficacy of our approach is validated against a real big data set, which has both online data traffic and offline data logs covering more than 1.9 billion devices."
w,"In this paper we focus on the problem of human activity recognition without identification of the individuals in a scene. We consider using Wi-Fi signals to detect certain human mobility behaviors such as stationary, walking, or running. The main objective is to successfully detect these behaviors for the individuals and based on that enable detection of the crowd's overall mobility behavior. We propose a method which infers mobility behaviors in two stages: from Wi-Fi signals to trajectories and from trajectories to the mobility behaviors. We evaluate the applicability of the proposed approach using the Student-Life dataset which contains Wi-Fi, GPS, and accelerometer measurements collected from smartphones of 49 students within a three-month period. The experimental results indicate that there is high correlation between stability of Wi-Fi signals and mobility activity. This unique characteristic provides sufficient evidences to extend the proposed idea to mobility analytics of groups of people in the future."

Additionally, the data-sharing model based on the DIKW hierarchy model is proposed to data classification belong to the level of data usage requirement of the user group to protect data with the right users for the right purpose."
w,"Voluminous amounts of data have been produced, since the past decade as the miniaturization of Internet of things (IoT) devices increases. However, such data are not useful without analytic power. Numerous big data, IoT, and analytics solutions have enabled people to obtain valuable insight into large data generated by IoT devices. However, these solutions are still in their infancy, and the domain lacks a comprehensive survey. This paper investigates the state-of-the-art research efforts directed toward big IoT data analytics. The relationship between big data analytics and IoT is explained. Moreover, this paper adds value by proposing a new architecture for big IoT data analytics. Furthermore, big IoT data analytic types, methods, and technologies for big data mining are discussed. Numerous notable use cases are also presented. Several opportunities brought by data analytics in IoT paradigm are then discussed. Finally, open research challenges, such as privacy, big data mining, visualization, and integration, are presented as future research directions."
w,"Finding an ideal home is a difficult and laborious process. One of the most crucial factors in this process is the reach ability between the home location and the concerned points of interest, such as places of work and recreational facilities. However, such importance is unrecognized in the extant real estate systems. By characterizing user requirements and analytical tasks in the context of finding ideal homes, we designed ReACH, a novel visual analytics system that assists people in finding, evaluating, and choosing a home based on multiple criteria, including reachability. In addition, we developed an improved data-driven model for approximating reachability with massive taxi trajectories. This model enables users to interactively integrate their knowledge and preferences to make judicious and informed decisions. We show the improvements in our model by comparing the theoretical complexities with the prior study and demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of the proposed system with task-based evaluation."
w,"Recent years have seen explosive emergence of the SMAC era, which is a combination of Social, Mobility, Analytics and Cloud Computing. The uses of Social networking are growing rapidly to collaborate at all levels of the extended enterprise. Employees are using Mobility to enhance the productivity. Apart from this people started to use Analytics based on big data and Cloud Computing which provides different services like Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). This abundance of services help businesses to develop approximate solutions that ultimately leads to leverage public IT infrastructure, minimizing cost of ownership and minimizing time. The deployment of SMAC in IT sector not only enhances the decision making capability but also allows them to rollout new unchecked business models and increase their reach to customers. Enterprises need to fully understand the capability and utilization of this emerging trend in order to make sense of their intended dominance in the next few years ahead."
w,"Understanding, exploring and investigating big data to inform the development of policies and best practices requires a solid analysis, identification and mapping of the key facets and aspects of big data. The objective of this paper is twofold: a) to provide a facet analysis of big data key topics and issues; and, b) to present a select number of information science research methodologies and study frameworks that may have the potential to be applied to research on big data. Six facets, namely data type, environment, people, operations and activities, analytics, and metadata are introduced to capture the key aspects of big data. Furthermore, sub-facets are created for each facet to demonstrate specific aspects that constitute the key topics. This type of conceptualization of big data will contribute to our learning and understanding of big data and its key components and characteristics. A number of suitable methodological frameworks from information science are introduced along with their potential applications for big data."
w,"Sentiment classification is a form of data analytics where people's feelings and attitudes toward a topic are mined from data. This tantalizing power to ``predict the zeitgeist'' means that sentiment classification has long attracted interest, but with mixed results. However, the recent development of the BERT framework and its pretrained neural language models is seeing new-found success for sentiment classification. BERT models are trained to capture word-level information via mask language modeling and sentence-level contexts via next sentence prediction tasks. Out of the box, they are adequate models for some natural language processing tasks. However, most models are further fine-tuned with domain-specific information to increase accuracy and usefulness. Motivated by the idea that a further fine-tuning step would improve the performance for downstream sentiment classification tasks, we developed TopicBERT--a BERT model fine-tuned to recognize topics at the corpus level in addition to the word and sentence levels. TopicBERT comprises two variants: TopicBERT-ATP (aspect topic prediction), which captures topic information via an auxiliary training task, and TopicBERT-TA, where topic representation is directly injected into a topic augmentation layer for sentiment classification. With TopicBERT-ATP, the topics are predetermined by an LDA mechanism and collapsed Gibbs sampling. With TopicBERT-TA, the topics can change dynamically during the training. Experimental results show that both approaches deliver the state-of-the-art performance in two different domains with SemEval 2014 Task 4. However, in a test of methods, direct augmentation outperforms further training. Comprehensive analyses in the form of ablation, parameter, and complexity studies accompany the results."
w,"With advancements in technology, huge volumes of valuable data have been generated and collected at a rapid velocity from a wide variety of rich data sources. Examples of these valuable data include healthcare and disease data such as privacy-preserving statistics on patients who suffered from diseases like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Analyzing these data can be for social good. For instance, data analytics on the healthcare and disease data often leads to the discovery of useful information and knowledge about the disease. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) further enhances the interpretability of the discovered knowledge. Consequently, the explainable data analytics helps people to get a better understanding of the disease, which may inspire them to take part in preventing, detecting, controlling and combating the disease. In this paper, we present an explainable data analytics system for disease and healthcare informatics. Our system consists of two key components. The predictor component analyzes and mines historical disease and healthcare data for making predictions on future data. Although huge volumes of disease and healthcare data have been generated, volumes of available data may vary partially due to privacy concerns. So, the predictor makes predictions with different methods. It uses random forest With sufficient data and neural network-based few-shot learning (FSL) with limited data. The explainer component provides the general model reasoning and a meaningful explanation for specific predictions. As a database engineering application, we evaluate our system by applying it to real-life COVID-19 data. Evaluation results show the practicality of our system in explainable data analytics for disease and healthcare informatics."
w,"Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) brings together computers, devices, advanced analytics, and people in industries, such as transportation, oil plant, and power grid that leads to major efficiency and productivity gains for almost any industrial procedures. Due to the interconnection of devices in IIoT, communication security has become a critical issue to address in many emerging industry standards that require the authentication and key exchange procedure to be done to guarantee the authorized machine access (e.g., from users) and secure the data transmission between machines. To overcome the shortcoming (i.e., low entropy) of the memorable password in user authentication, it is rightfully recommended by industry standards (such as IEC-62443 family) to use multifactor authentication for higher security levels. Notably, latency is one of the main sources of inefficiency when a device is communicating with other machines on IIoT. To mitigate latency, a smooth projective hash function built from well-studied standard assumptions is used to achieve a low-interactivity multifactor authenticated key exchange protocol allows each party to prove to the others that he knows the right authentication factor(s). In this article, we are, therefore, motivated to build a new named secure remote multifactor to achieve the human-involved machine-to-machine secure communication in IIoT. That is,, and multifactor key exchange (). Furthermore, to prevent authentication factors stored at the server exposing to attackers, the password-harden service (i.e., Pythia-PRF and USENIX15) inspires us to develop a multifactor hardening service utilizing an oblivious pseudorandom function . The balanced security of the proposed protocol is proved under the model of BellarePointchevalRogaway (EUROCRYPTO00) along with theoretical and experimental evaluations."

IoT exploits connectivity between physical objects like fridges, cars, utilities, buildings and cities for enhancing the lives of people through automation and data analytics. However, this sudden increase in connected heterogeneous IoT devices takes a huge toll on the existing Internet infrastructure and introduces new challenges for researchers to embark upon. This paper highlights the effects of heterogeneity challenges on connectivity, interoperability, management in greater details. It also surveys some of the existing solutions adopted in the core network to solve the challenges of massive IoT deployment. The paper finally concludes that IoT architecture and network infrastructure needs to be reengineered ground-up, so that IoT solutions can be safely and efficiently deployed."

In addressing these challenges, my dissertation explores how AI-augmented analytics can improve computer-mediated communication between speakers of different native languages. First, to support better sense making of foreign language posts in social media, I designed SenseTrans, a tool that adds contextual information using AI-analytics such as sentiment analysis. In my future work, I intend to explore 1) how people perceive, interpret and make use of AI-generated information, and 2) how AI-augmented analytics could be applied to other settings."
w,"Over the last three decades, the practice of HR has experienced significant transformation. This has included HR moving from being a lower level, administrative and maintenance oriented function to operating in many organizations as a core business function and a strategic business partner. Because of dramatic changes that have occurred in HR, the question arises whether HR has arrived at its final destination or whether the journey will continue and if so, what is next for HR? In setting the stage to discuss the future of HR, we briefly describe the journey HR has traveled thus far since its emergence as afield. We characterize HR'S journey as having a singular direction and that is to add value to the organization. To continue in this direction we propose that future HR will need to adopt an outside/inside approach where the external environment and stakeholders influence what HR does inside the organization. From this, we discuss other specific actions HR will need, in order to add value, with respect to targets for HR work (individual, organizational, and leadership) and areas for HR investments (HR function, HR practices, HR people, and HR analytics). We present a number of propositions on these that can be used by researchers and practitioners in guiding future research and practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
w,"When analyzing human behaviors, we need to construct the human behaviors from multiple sources of data, e.g. trajectory data, transaction data, identity data, etc. The problems we're facing are the data conflicts, different resolution, missing and conflicting data, which together lead to the uncertainty in the spatial temporal data. Such uncertainty in data leads to difficulties and even failure in the visual analytics task for analyzing people behavior, pattern and outliers. However, traditional automatic methods can not solve the problems in such complex scenario, where the uncertain and conflicting patterns are not well-defined. To solve the problems, we proposed a semi-automatic approach, for users to solve the conflicts and identify the uncertainties. To be general, we summarized five types of uncertainties and solutions to conduct the tasks of behavior analysis. Combined with the uncertainty-aware methods, we proposed a visual analytics system to analyze human behaviors, detect patterns and find outliers. Case studies from the IEEE VAST Challenge 2014 dataset confirm the effectiveness of our approach."

We consider both strategic immersion through more accessible systems as well as enhanced understanding and control through immersive interfaces that enable rapid workflows. We extend the classic sensemaking loop from visual analytics to incorporate multiple views, scenarios, people, and computational agents. We consider both sides of machine/human collaboration: allowing the human to more fluidly control the machine process; and also allowing the human to understand the results, derive insights and continue the analytic cycle. We also consider system and algorithmic implications of enabling realtime control and feedback in immersive human-centered computational analytics."
w,"This study delves into the idea of data analytics and investigates the rhetoric through which its qualities are rendered accessible to people. It poses the following research question: How is data analytics and its relationship to organisations made attractive through rhetorical strategies? The analysis is based on 16 articles on data analytics published in the Harvard Business Review (HBR) from 2006 to 2020. Due to the analysis, two rhetorical strategies were identified: creativity and delegation. The findings suggested that contradictions prevail in the idea of data analytics. The creativity strategy underscores the illumination of possibilities in the application of data analytics, whereas the delegation strategy increasingly emphasises the need for organisational change, including the redistribution of work. In this study, we suggest that while data analytics can bring about various benefits, it can also create new uncertainties in an organisation. The contradictory features of data analytics may easily go unrecognised by practitioners."

One of the most important technology advancement is the fast growth of social media platforms that became invaluable media in the hand of people. While, people can share their opinions about services and products in public and with their social circles. However, it is massive amounts of unstructured data that is difficult to extract meaningful information out of them. Such data can be extracted from social media to support personal decisions. Social media analytics can take insights out of data and analyze its sentiment rather than just reading and counting text.

Previous studies reveal that people's stances towards rumorous messages can provide indicative clues for identifying the veracity of rumors, and thus determining the stances of public reactions is a crucial preceding step for rumor veracity prediction. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical multi-task learning framework for jointly predicting rumor stance and veracity on Twitter, which consists of two components. The bottom component of our framework classifies the stances of tweets in a conversation discussing a rumor via modeling the structural property based on a novel graph convolutional network. The top component predicts the rumor veracity by exploiting the temporal dynamics of stance evolution. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms previous methods in both rumor stance classification and veracity prediction."

w,"Historians and archivists often find and analyze the occurrences of query words in newspaper archives to help answer fundamental questions about society. But much work in text analytics focuses on helping people investigate other textual units, such as events, clusters, ranked documents, entity relationships, or thematic hierarchies. Informed by a study into the needs of historians and archivists, we thus propose CLIOQUERY, a text analytics system uniquely organized around the analysis of query words in context. CLIOQUERY applies text simplification techniques from natural language processing to help historians quickly and comprehensively gather and analyze all occurrences of a query word across an archive. It also pairs these new NLP methods with more traditional features like linked views and in-text highlighting to help engender trust in summarization techniques. We evaluate CLIOQUERY with two separate user studies, in which historians explain how CLIOQUERY's novel text simplification features can help facilitate historical research. We also evaluate with a separate quantitative comparison study, which shows that CLIOQUERY helps crowdworkers find and remember historical information. Such results suggest possible new directions for text analytics in other query-oriented settings."
w,"The integration of the Internet of Things with the Cloud improves our lives by facilitating smooth connections between people and items. Predictive analytics, fueled by cutting-edge machine learning and artificial intelligence, turns reactive healthcare initiatives into proactive ones. A subset of machine learning called deep learning is essential for quickly analyzing large datasets, producing insightful conclusions, and efficiently addressing challenging problems. For early interventions and preventive care, especially for those who are at risk, accurate and timely illness prediction is crucial. Making accurate prediction models becomes crucial when utilizing electronic medical records. Accuracy is improved by using deep learning variations of recurrent neural networks that can handle sequential time-series data. Predictive analytics is applied to cloud-stored electronic medical records and data from Internet of Things devices in this suggested system. With a remarkable accuracy of 98.86%, the smart healthcare system is intended to monitor and anticipate the risk of heart disease utilizing Bi-LSTM (bidirectional long short-term memory). Furthermore, it reaches 98.9% accuracy, 98.8% sensitivity, 98.89% specificity, and 98.86% F-measure. These outcomes greatly surpass the performance of current smart heart disease prediction systems."
w,"In this study, we monitored power consumption to analyze the impact of energy usage on people's well-being. Data analytics is playing a key role in grid operation and the benefits derived from it. We use change point detection techniques to identify instances where power consumption time-series significantly change. Wavelets and adaptive chi-square and Ljung-Box tests are computed to detect these changes using real-world data. It has been shown that there is a strong positive correlation between quality of life and electricity consumption in impoverished countries. Once different levels of consumption are identified due to the use of different appliances, citizens well-being derived from these levels are linked to the relevant elements described in the Gallup-Healthways Report. Furthermore, it is important to come up with methodologies that rely on affordable meters, and thus allow users to manage their power consumption in a distributed manner and maximize their well-being."
w,"With the emerging sensing technologies, such as mobile crowdsensing and Internet of Things, people-centric data can be efficiently collected and used for analytics and optimization purposes. These data are typically required to develop and render people-centric services. In this paper, we address the privacy implication, optimal pricing, and bundling of people-centric services. We first define the inverse correlation between the service quality and privacy level from data analytics perspectives. We then present the profit maximization models of selling standalone, complementary, and substitute services. Specifically, the closed-form solutions of the optimal privacy level and subscription fee are derived to maximize the gross profit of service providers. For interrelated people-centric services, we show that cooperation by service bundling of complementary services is profitable compared with the separate sales but detrimental for substitutes. We also show that the market value of a service bundle is correlated with the degree of contingency between the interrelated services. Finally, we incorporate the profit sharing models from game theory for dividing the bundling profit among the cooperative service providers."
w,"Globally, smart cities, infrastructure, and transportation have led to a rise in vehicle numbers, resulting in an increasing number of problems. This includes problems such as air pollution, noise pollution, high energy consumption, and people's health. A viable solution to these problems is carpooling, which involves sharing vehicles between people going to the same location. As carpooling solutions become more popular, they need to be implemented efficiently. Data analytics can help people make informed decisions when selecting a ride (Car or Bus). We applied machine learning algorithms to select the desired ride (Car or Bus) and used feature ranking algorithms to identify the foremost traits for selecting the desired ride. Based on the performance evaluation metric, 11 classifiers were used for the experiment. In terms of selecting the desired ride, Random Forest performs best. Using ten-fold cross-validation, we obtained a sensitivity of 87.4%, a specificity of 73.7%, an accuracy of 81.0%, a sensitivity of 90.8%, a specificity of 77.6%, and an accuracy of 84.7% using leave-one-out cross-validation. To identify the most favorable characteristics of the Ride (Car or Bus), the recursive elimination of features algorithm was applied. By identifying the factors contributing to users' experience, the service providers will be able to rectify those factors to increase business. It has been determined that the weather can make or break the user experience. This model will be used to quantify and map intrinsic and extrinsic sentiments of the people and their interactions with locality, socio-economic conditions, climate, and environment."
w,"The paper considers two problems of video analytics, which can be solved by tracking people in a video stream: people counting and estimation of queue waiting time. Modern video surveillance systems have several hundred thousand cameras, which is why one of the most important problems that video analytics has to face is the optimization of computing resource usage. Most presently available tracking algorithms are inefficient because they use computationally expensive CNN-based detectors on frequent video frames. In this paper, we propose methods for solving the problems mentioned above, which improve overall efficiency by applying detection on sparse frames. The experimental evaluation of the proposed methods shows their consistency in terms of both performance and computing resource usage."
w,"Purpose This project aimed to use advanced multivariate analytics at scale for troubleshooting and improving the process robustness of pharmaceutical products. Additionally, the project aimed to make technology more accessible and empower people to use advanced analytics on the roadmap of Industry 4.0. Methods A web-based platform based on advanced analytics was designed and implemented. Using this platform, data was accessed from the cloud database with a few clicks, analyzed and interpreted using Advanced Analytics by end users who are Process Subject Matter Experts without much background in Data Science.

Three application case studies are demonstrated, where conclusions drawn from the process models combined with the subject matter expertise successfully solved problems in a pharmaceutical industrial setting. Conclusion Considering the criticality of the drug product and the complex manufacturing processes in the pharmaceutical industry, this article establishes how historical data can be leveraged at scale to get value and meaningful conclusions using multivariate models and machine learning algorithms."
w,"Gender identity is one of the most fundamental aspects of life. Automatic gender identification is increasingly being used in areas such as security, marketing, and social robots. The objective of this paper is to address the challenges of gender and age identification in very crowded/noisy environments where faces are unclear and/or people are moving in relatively random directions. It presents an end -to -end real-time intelligent video analytics solution for instant people counting, gender and age estimation in crowded and open environments. The proposed solution includes a complete pipeline for training vision deep learning models and deploying them to edge devices connected to a distributed streaming analytics server. Our final Deep Learning architecture is an extended version of FairMOT, a multi -object tracking model, with two additional layers for multi -class gender classification and age regression. The training phase is performed using an enhanced and enriched version of the CrowdHuman dataset, a public dataset for human detection, with gender and age annotations added. The overall system has been validated for various movies and has shown state-of-the-art performance in terms of people tracking, gender and age inference. Our code, models, and data can be found at https: //github.com/jasseur2017/people_gender_age."
w,"Social media has emerged as one of the data backbones of urban analytics systems. Thanks to geo-located microposts (text-, image-, and video-based) created and shared through portals such as Twitter and Instagram, scientists and practitioners can capitalise on the availability of real-time and semantically rich data sources to perform studies related to cities and the people inhabiting them. Urban analytics systems usually consider the micro posts originating from within a city's boundary uniformly, without consideration for the demographic (e.g. gender, age), geographic, technological or contextual (e.g. role in the city) differences among a platform's users. It is well-known though, that the usage and adoption of social media profoundly differ across user segments, cities, as well as countries. We thus advocate for a better understanding of the intrinsic diversity of social media users and contents. This paper presents an observational study of the geo-located activities of users across two social media platforms, performed over a period of three weeks in four European cities. We show how demographic, geographical, technological and contextual properties of social media (and their users) can provide very different reflections and interpretations of the reality of an urban environment."
w,"Immersive visualization in virtual reality (VR) allows us to exploit visual cues for perception in 3D space, yet few existing studies have measured the effects of visual cues. Across a desktop monitor and a head-mounted display (HMD), we assessed scatterplot designs which vary their use of visual cues-motion, shading, perspective (graphical projection), and dimensionality-on two sets of data. We conducted a user study with a summary task in which 32 participants estimated the classification accuracy of an artificial neural network from the scatterplots. With Bayesian multilevel modeling, we capture the intricate visual effects and find that no cue alone explains all the variance in estimation error. Visual motion cues generally reduce participants' estimation error; besides this motion, using other cues may increase participants' estimation error. Using an HMD, adding visual motion cues, providing a third data dimension, or showing a more complicated dataset leads to longer response times. We speculate that most visual cues may not strongly affect perception in immersive analytics unless they change people's mental model about data. In summary, by studying participants as they interpret the output from a complicated machine learning model, we advance our understanding of how to use the visual cues in immersive analytics."
w,"Microsoft Power BI is one of the visual analytics platforms that help people to see and understand the data. This research aimed to evaluate students' satisfaction and loyalty to the Microsoft Power BI application. The method used in this research utilized the DECIDE framework to determine the evaluation goals, explore the questions, choose the evaluation and data collection methods, and identify the practical issues. The evaluation was conducted using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and Net Promoter Score (NPS). The application's score using SUS was 51 and the NPS score was below 6. The result showed that students are not quite satisfied and loyal to the application. This finding is part of the product lifecycle where users gave feedback for the improvement of the product to satisfy users' needs, even though this finding is only in small scope at Bina Nusantara University. Therefore, the corporation should review the application in terms of features, performance, and tutorials and invest more resources in marketing activities to acquire new customers, including academic fields, reducing its competitiveness in the market. In addition, we proved that without asking Net Promoter Score (NPS) questions, the Net Promoter Score (NPS) values could be taken from SUS to determine participant loyalty."
w,"We present a new visual exploration concept-Progressive Visual Analytics with Safeguards-that helps people manage the uncertainty arising from progressive data exploration. Despite its potential benefits, intermediate knowledge from progressive analytics can be incorrect due to various machine and human factors, such as a sampling bias or misinterpretation of uncertainty. To alleviate this problem, we introduce PVA-Guards, safeguards people can leave on uncertain intermediate knowledge that needs to be verified, and derive seven PVA-Guards based on previous visualization task taxonomies. PVA-Guards provide a means of ensuring the correctness of the conclusion and understanding the reason when intermediate knowledge becomes invalid. We also present ProReveal, a proof-of-concept system designed and developed to integrate the seven safeguards into progressive data exploration. Finally, we report a user study with 14 participants, which shows people voluntarily employed PVA-Guards to safeguard their findings and ProReveal's PVA-Guard view provides an overview of uncertain intermediate knowledge. We believe our new concept can also offer better consistency in progressive data exploration, alleviating people's heterogeneous interpretation of uncertainty."
w,"Most modern trains are equipped with onboard CCTV technology, which can be used for a wide variety of applications, such as automatic detection of objects, people, or situations by video analytics. Such as with all detection systems, thorough calibration of the sensors, i.e., cameras in our case, is essential to minimize false alarms and achieve a very high detection rate. From an operational point of view, false alarms should be minimal or not occur at all. From a reliability point of view, no real objects or people shall be missed, especially when it comes to airport security. Unfortunately, operational availability and detection reliability are contradictory parameters. They both depend on the chosen sensitivity of the sensors. Typically, high sensitivity results in a high detection rate (which is desired) but can produce a couple of false alarms. While a low sensitivity will reduce the number of false alarms but some smaller objects may not be detected. This paper presents an approach to analyze the detection performance and choose suitable parameter settings to satisfy both."
w,"In this paper, we deal with questions related to blockchains in complex Internet of Things (IoT)-based ecosystems. Such ecosystems are typically composed of IoT devices, edge devices, cloud computing software services, as well as people, who are decision makers in scenarios such as smart cities. Many decisions related to analytics can be based on data coming from IoT sensors, software services, and people. However, they are typically based on different levels of abstraction and granularity. This poses a number of challenges when multiple blockchains are used together with smart contracts. This work proposes to apply our concept of elasticity to smart contracts and thereby enabling analytics in and between multiple blockchains in the context of IoT. We propose a reference architecture for Elastic Smart Contracts and evaluate the approach in a smart city scenario, discussing the benefits in terms of performance and self-adaptability of our solution."
w,"The adoption of remote assisted care was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This type of system acquires data from various sensors, runs analytics to understand people's activities, behavior, and living problems, and disseminates information with healthcare stakeholders to support timely follow-up and intervention. Blockchain technology may offer good technical solutions for tackling Internet of Things monitoring, data management, interventions, and privacy concerns in ambient assisted living applications. Even though the integration of blockchain technology with assisted care is still at the beginning, it has the potential to change the health and care processes through a secure transfer of patient data, better integration of care services, or by increasing coordination and awareness across the continuum of care. The motivation of this paper is to systematically review and organize these elements according to the main problems addressed. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies conducted that address the solutions for integrating blockchain technology with ambient assisted living systems. To conduct the review, we have followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology with clear criteria for including and excluding papers, allowing the reader to effortlessly gain insights into the current state-of-the-art research in the field. The results highlight the advantages and open issues that would require increased attention from the research community in the coming years. As for directions for further research, we have identified data sharing and integration of care paths with blockchain, storage, and transactional costs, personalization of data disclosure paths, interoperability with legacy care systems, legal issues, and digital rights management."
w,"This article deals with choice-inducing algorithms--algorithms that are explicitly designed to affect people's choices. Based on an ethnographic account of three Israeli data analytics companies, I explore how algorithms are being designed to drive people into choice-making and examine their co-constitution by an assemblage of specifically positioned human and nonhuman agents. I show that the functioning, logic, and even ethics of choice-inducing algorithms are deeply influenced by the epistemologies, meaning systems, and practices of the individuals who devise and use them and that such algorithms are similarly affected by interorganizational relationships, various nonhuman agents, and changing geopolitical contexts. I conclude by discussing the flexibility of choice-inducing algorithms and by arguing that such algorithms are not programmed to induce specific choices but to more generally convert people into choosers, and thus, to algorithmically (re)create the modern need to choose. This article contributes to the growing literature on algorithms and culture and to our understanding of choice-making in contemporary life. At the same time, it provides a new vocabulary that offers to critically engage with algorithms and their power without losing sight of the often very specific contexts from which they arise."
w,"With the development of social media (e.g. Twitter, Flickr, Foursquare, Sina Weibo, etc.), a large number of people are now using them and post microblogs, messages and multi-media information. The everyday usage of social media results in big open social media data. The data offer fruitful information and reflect social behaviors of people. There is much visualization and visual analytics research on such data. We collect state-of-the-art research and put it into three main categories: social network, spatial temporal information and text analysis. We further summarize the visual analytics pipeline for the social media, combining the above categories and supporting complex tasks. With these techniques, social media analytics can apply to multiple disciplines. We summarize the applications and public tools to further investigate the challenges and trends."
w,"The insights into additive manufacturing, the Internet of Things, and analytics enable us to help organizations reassess their people, processes, and technologies in light of advanced manufacturing practices that are evolving every day. Manufacturing processes are becoming increasingly digital. As this trend unfolds, many companies often struggle to determine what they should be doing to drive and deliver real value both operationally and strategically. Indeed digital solutions may promise significant value for an organization. Of particular fascination of late seems to be the notion of a digital twin: a near-real-time digital image of a physical object or process that helps optimize business performance."
w,"Imagining big data brings up a palette of concerns about their technological intricacies, political significance, commercial value, and cultural impact. We look at this emerging arena of public sense-making and consider the spectrum of press illustrations that are employed to show what big data are and what their consequences could be. We collected all images from big data-related articles published in the online editions of The New York Times and The Washington Post. As the first examination of the visual dimension of big data news reports to date, our study suggests that big data are predominantly illustrated with reference to their areas of application and the people and materials involved in data analytics. As such, they provide concrete physical form to abstract data. Rather than conceiving of potential ramifications that are more or less likely to materialize, the dominant mode of illustration draws on existing, though often trite, visual evidence."
w,"In the second decade of the 21st century, we see the proliferation of cloud computing, Internet of Things/People, and big data/analytics, and the rejuvenation of Artificial Intelligence, robotics, virtual realities and augmented realities, etc., which have triggered the trends of building smart nations, smart cities, smart offices and smart homes all over the world. Such a trend has also shown its influence in the learning technology field where scholars and developers have begun to adapt and synthesize such state-of-the-art technologies to construct smart learning environments and tools. Notwithstanding, it is the time for us to take a step back and reflect upon-in the era where even intelligent robots could sit in high-stakes examinations and perform better than most of the human students, what kind of smart students and smart citizens do we really need and want to foster? What kinds of smart learning environments do that we need to develop to achieve the stated aim? What are the underpinning educational principles that the designers of such environments should adopt? This panel aims to bring together scholars who have worked in specific learning technologies or technology-aided pedagogies to co-identify the human-oriented (rather than technology-driven) objectives of the smart learning wave, and to possibly relook or even re-define the notion of smart learning."
w,"Damming rivers started in India at an incredible pace since Independence to achieve the objective of flood control and meet massive water crisis, primarily for agricultural and drinking purposes, secondarily for power generation and industrial use and resultant economic growth. This paper analyses the development fiasco by recalling the issues of Hirakund and Sardar Sarovar's (SS) multipurpose dams, resulting in changes in social, economic, ecology and environmental factors in the command area in Mahanadi and Narmada River valleys, respectively, being most controversial. The essay 'The Greater Common Good' by Arundhati Roy has been chosen to analyse the effectiveness of a writer's direct involvement as an activist in agitation for displaced people besides eye-opening analytics of controversies related to the SS project. This paper also studied the anticipated effect on social, economic, and environmental factors in the command area of sanctioned Ken and Betwa river linking projects (KBP) by co-relating issues of multipurpose dams. A discussion on rationalisation of the grievances of marginalised people due to delivery of various government schemes to the last corner of the country in the growing digital eco-system along with the possibilities of enactment of a national law for regulating the construction of water infrastructure and its operation and maintenance through regulatory mechanism with a holistic approach."
w,"This paper deals with people counting in stores for business analytics using stereo vision. Among the several problems in this type of applications, two are the most relevant for our purposes: the management of occlusions and the distinction between adult people (potential customers) and other objects (children, trolleys, strollers, animals, etc.). The proposed solution uses a novel approach for object detection (based on background suppression on a so-called depth bird-eye view and the clustering on the 3D point cloud by means of mean shift with a cylindrical kernel) followed by an adult people classifier which exploits a fitness measure with respect to a cylindrical human body model. The fitness is computed using Montecarlo sampling to estimate the volume occupation. Experiments are conducted on two real setups (including a store in a normal day of activity) and compared with a previous work. The results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed solution."
w,"In this Big Data era, digital data has been increased exponentially with great variety. While lots of data carrying personal information has been purposely entered online, a large amount of data has been logged from people's online footprints. Big Data analytics has enabled researchers or other stakeholders to dig out data and then turn it into useful or interesting information to serve for whatever purpose and interest. As a society, there is no way to reverse information exploration, and as an individual, there is no more a safe haven for personal privacy. Individuals should be aware of the situation and take necessary measures to protect their own privacy, and most importantly change their perception of privacy. Starting with a brief review of privacy information and its rules, this paper proposes a classification of different online footprints where personal privacy could be compromised, then provides ideas and approaches to deal with the Big Data privacy."
w,"Background: Low infection and case-fatality rates have been thus far observed in Taiwan. One of the reasons for this major success is better use of big data analytics in efficient contact tracing and management and surveillance of those who require quarantine and isolation. Objective: We present here a unique application of big data analytics among Taiwanese people who had contact with more than 3000 passengers that disembarked at Keelung harbor in Taiwan for a 1-day tour on January 31, 2020, 5 days before the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the Diamond Princess cruise ship on February 5, 2020, after an index case was identified on January 20, 2020. Methods: The smart contact tracing-based mobile sensor data, cross-validated by other big sensor surveillance data, were analyzed by the mobile geopositioning method and rapid analysis to identify 627,386 potential contact-persons. Information on self-monitoring and self-quarantine was provided via SMS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests were offered for symptomatic contacts. National Health Insurance claims big data were linked, to follow-up on the outcome related to COVID-19 among those who were hospitalized due to pneumonia and advised to undergo screening for SARS-CoV-2. Results: As of February 29, a total of 67 contacts who were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were all negative and no confirmed COVID-19 cases were found. Less cases of respiratory syndrome and pneumonia were found after the follow-up of the contact population compared with the general population until March 10, 2020. Conclusions: Big data analytics with smart contact tracing, automated alert messaging for self-restriction, and follow-up of the outcome related to COVID-19 using health insurance data could curtail the resources required for conventional epidemiological contact tracing."
w,"The ubiquity of self-tracking devices and smartphone apps has empowered people to collect data about themselves and try to self-improve. However, people with little to no personal analytics experience may not be able to analyze data or run experiments on their own (self-experiments). To lower the barrier to intervention-based self-experimentation, we developed an app called Self-E, which guides users through the experiment. We conducted a 2-week diary study with 16 participants from the local population and a second study with a more advanced group of users to investigate how they perceive and carry out self-experiments with the help of Self-E, and what challenges they face. We fnd that users are infuenced by their preconceived notions of how healthy a given behavior is, making it difficult to follow Self-E's directions and trusting its results. We present suggestions to overcome this challenge, such as by incorporating empathy and scafolding in the system."
w,"Most of Big Data and Analytics work is focused on getting people to do what other people want them to do. What if it could be turned around? What if all the data collected on or about individuals could instead be used to help individuals in ways they want to be helped? What if the data could help individuals achieve their life goals and dreams, and coach them through the process of life? If these individuals benefit from such a service and begin living happier, balanced, and fulfilled lives they will also become more beneficial employees to organizations and more successful members of society. In this paper, we are proposing a conceptual model of how such a system might be developed and used to benefit employees, organizations, and common citizens to build a better world through information systems. This includes assistance and guidance with careers, health, sustainability, relationships, personal finances, and overall happiness and well-being."
w,"Over 2019, the breadth of articles published in the Journal of Learning Analytics reflects the diversity of contributions to the field, including quantitative, qualitative, and design-based studies and contributions through the different submission types (Research, Practical, Data and Tools, and Book Review). This year, we have also published two special sections. The first is a set of empirical papers related to the emerging area of human-centred learning analytics (HCLA). In this section, five sets of authors each address the core challenge of how to design and implement learning analytics in ways that are people-centric rather than technology-centric to achieve impact in the field. The second is a new format for the journal, an invited dialogue around a critical community issue. In this section, Neil Selwyn asks the intentionally provocative question, What's the problem with learning analytics?, which is engaged with by four respondents from the community, representing a variety of perspectives. Both of these special sections tackle, in their own way, a central issue for the learning analytics community: how we ensure that the work we do has a positive impact in the world."
w,"The integration of human intellectual capabilities into the process of building a machine learning model is the most promising area. The advantage of this area is to effectively combine the capabilities of both human and machine through the use of visual analytics. Visual analytics combines machine learning, data transformation, and data visualization, that enables people to understand big and complex data. Using this approach, a human can form a mental model of a decision-making mechanism based on data analysis. To enable the machine to use this model, it is necessary to transform it into the form used by the machine. The paper proposes an information technology for transforming a model from the domain of human understanding into machine representation through formalization. The practical application of this technology is presented using the data classification method as an example. Data is visualized by lowering the dimension of the feature space. Using visual analytics, a human forms a classification model that is transformed into machine form through formalization. This research allows us to demonstrate the effectiveness of humanmachine interaction in the process of model building and the model transformation technique."
w,"This article examines digital traces related to the use of self-tracking devices in the context of digitally mediated iTime. These devices enable the continual production, representation, interpretation, and negotiation of varied traces of physical activity, time use, and temporal coordination. We focus on temporalities, exploring how the tendencies of iTime are being differentially produced, encountered, interpreted, and acted on in daily life. In-depth interviews with 25 individuals between 18 and 24 years of age are used to examine the contexts of trace production and analysis as they take place within different configurations of ordinary practice. First, we examine whether continuously self-tracked data alters people's sense of the temporal possibilities of self-transformation. Second, we ask whether people's encounters with, and analytics of, their traces alter how their daily life is temporally sequenced, coordinated, and experienced. Third, we consider if and in what ways quantified and visualized self-tracked data change the temporal meaning and value of media-related practices for those undertaking them. We show how digital traces are produced within, and become concrete elements of, the temporalities of practices."

Against this background, how to make better use of these data and display them in a visualized manner has become an urgent issue in applying learning analytics to education and learning process. This paper introduced the current research status and relevant cases of learning analytics visualization, brought forward learning analytics visualization model, and then displayed the design connotation of learning analytics visualization from the perspectives of different stakeholders (students, teachers and administrators)."

w,"The popularity of big data and business analytics has increased tremendously in the last decade and a key challenge for organizations is in understanding how to leverage them to create business value. However, while the literature acknowledges the importance of these topics little work has addressed them from the organization's point of view. This paper investigates the challenges faced by organizational managers seeking to become more data and information-driven in order to create value. Empirical research comprised a mixed methods approach using (1) a Delphi study with practitioners through various forums and (2) interviews with business analytics managers in three case organizations. The case studies reinforced the Delphi findings and highlighted several challenge focal areas: organizations need a clear data and analytics strategy, the right people to effect a data-driven cultural change, and to consider data and information ethics when using data for competitive advantage. Further, becoming data-driven is not merely a technical issue and demands that organizations firstly organize their business analytics departments to comprise business analysts, data scientists, and IT personnel, and secondly align that business analytics capability with their business strategy in order to tackle the analytics challenge in a systemic and joined up way. As a result, this paper presents a business analytics ecosystem for organizations that contributes to the body of scholarly knowledge by identifying key business areas and functions to address to achieve this transformation.

w,"Geo-tagged microblog data covers billions of movement patterns on a global and local scale. Understanding these patterns could guide urban and traffic planning or help coping with disaster situations. We present a visual analytics system to investigate travel trajectories of people reconstructed from microblog messages. To analyze seasonal changes and events and to validate movement patterns against other data sources, we contribute highly interactive visual comparison methods that normalize and contrast trajectories as well as density maps within a single view. We also compute an adaptive hierarchical graph from the trajectories to abstract individual movements into higher-level structures. Specific challenges that we tackle are, among others, the spatio-temporal sparsity of the data, the volume of data varying by region, and a diverse mix of means of transportation. The applicability of our approach is presented in three case studies."
w,"The Internet of Things (IoT) enables the realization of future learning environments, which include tools and techniques for personalized learning, virtual and augmented reality, cloud computing, 3-D printing, interactive whiteboards, deep learning and big data analytics. As the field of e-learning is expanding without a clear vision on how heterogeneous things and e-learning infrastructures should inter-operate, ensuring interoperability in the IoT-enabled future learning environments is crucial. To facilitate seamless communication and resources sharing between heterogeneous and geographically distributed e-learning infrastructures, IoT devices, people, and software tools for big data analytics, numerous challenges need to be addressed, such as: technical and semantic interoperability challenges, as well as ethical and privacy concerns. This article explores the challenges for ensuring interoperability in the emerging IoTenabled future learning environments. A taxonomy is developed, supporting a comprehensive analysis of ten challenges identified."
w,This paper presents the design and development of the CloudUPDRS app and supporting system developed as a Class I medical device to assess the severity of motor symptoms for Parkinson's Disease. We report on lessons learnt towards meeting fidelity and regulatory requirements; effective procedures employed to structure user context and ensure data quality; a robust service provision architecture; a dependable analytics toolkit; and provisions to meet mobility and social needs of people with Parkinson's.
w,"In concert with recent attempts to move beyond long-standing psychoanalytic equations of transsexuality with psychoses, this article offers some possible ways to consider the Tiresian as a site of both cissexual and transsexual fantasy and analytic fictions. It is interested in both the utility of a nonpathologizing psychoanalysis for trans people and in the capacity of trans people's literary writing to offer alternative imaginaries, knowledges, and analytics through which to reread and revise psychoanalytic conceptions of identity (sexed, raced, gendered) in relation to desire, time, and the human."
w,"The advent of the Internet of things (IoT) has radically changed the way in which computations and communications are carried out. People are just becoming another component of IoT environments, and in turn, IoT environments are becoming a mixture of platforms, software, services, things, and people. The price we pay for such dynamic and powerful environment is an intrinsic uncertainty and low trustworthiness due to its opaque perimeter, the multitude of different data sources with unknown providers, and uncertain responsibilities. Trustworthiness of observables collected by smart devices (from minuscle sensors to bigger machines) is fundamental to build a chain of trust on a decision process taken according to these observables. Some assurance solutions evaluate the quality of collected data, although they are difficult to apply in IoT environments for performance and cost reasons. In this paper, we take a different approach and put forward the idea that, in many cases, the behavior of people owning smart devices can contribute to the evaluation of the trustworthiness of collected data and, in turn, of the whole decision process. We therefore define an assurance methodology based on data analytics evaluating the compliance of people to behavioral policies. The more people behavior is compliant, the higher the trustworthiness of data collected through their smart devices."
w,"In this research, we first aim at developing data analytics that can derive insights about how people from different regions communicate and connect via mobile phone calls and physical movements. We uncover the digital divide (geographical segregation of phone communication patterns) and the physical divide (geographical limits of human mobility) in Senegal. The research also demonstrates that the chosen spatial unit and temporal resolution can affect the community detection results of spatial interaction graphs when analyzing human mobility patterns and exploring urban dynamics in the mobile age. We find that the daily detection has generated a more stable partition structure than an hourly one, while monthly changes also exist over time. The presented framework can help identify patterns of spatial interaction in both cyberspace and physical space with phone call detailed records in some regions where census data acquisition is difficult, especially in African countries."
w,"This paper focuses on the feasibility of implementing a vision-based people counting system using footage from an existing surveillance camera in a restaurant establishment. The main challenge is to do so given the unique fixed viewpoint of the camera, which is optimized for security instead of data analytics. A three-step approach, namely people detection, tracking, and then people counting, is employed in creating the system. Neural networks such as YOLOv3 and Deep SORT are used. The proponents then partnered with a retail establishment in a high-traffic business district, to test the system. The results show that it is possible to achieve an accuracy of 82.76% for days when the restaurant waiting area is not crowded. The system also achieved an overall accuracy of 66.17% over five days of extensive testing, which includes extreme conditions wherein people in the video are densely packed and occluded. However, the system performance and accuracy can still be improved through downsizing the frames, retraining the models, and exploring other models."
w,"The value of technology lies not only with the service or functionality of the tool, but also with its subsequent value to the people who use it. New learning analytics ( LA) software and platforms for capturing data and improving student learning are frequently introduced; however, they suffer from issues of adoption and continued usage by stakeholders. Scholars have previously suggested that it is not enough to introduce stakeholders (e.g., teachers and students) to LA technologies; they must also be a part of the LA creation and design process. In this paper, we will continue the ongoing work to clarify and compare different approaches of human-centred design through an overview of participatory frameworks in LA (co-design, co-creation). We will also present a case study using an LA tool used and developed within several Australian universities that was utilized over six years as an example of how LA designers can co-create dynamic platforms with teachers. Implications of participatory design frameworks in LA will also be presented through a discussion of the costs, challenges, and benefits of adopting human-centred design."
w,"Reducing energy consumption, improving energy efficiency, and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are among the most important initiatives in today's world. Occupied buildings consume a substantial amount of energy, mounting to about 40% of overall energy consumption in most countries. The majority of the world's population either lives or works in buildings; therefore, everybody can contribute in reducing energy consumption, controlling GHG emissions, and mitigating climate change and its potential impact. We developed an analytical tool that can assist building owners, facility managers, operators, and tenants of buildings in assessing, benchmarking, diagnosing, tracking, forecasting, simulating, and optimizing energy consumption in building portfolios. Furthermore, for greater dissemination, we have made this analytic service available on demand in a flexible cloud environment. Cloud is an efficient and effective medium to provide building energy analytics capability to various functions and people in a variety of roles in buildings without investing a substantial amount of money in hardware, software, and information technology infrastructure. We present results of the building energy analytics developed for K-12 public school buildings and a commercial office building complex."
w,"Until now, little research has been conducted to analyse Twitter conversations about the corporate sponsors of football clubs. The conventional and most widely used method has been to use content analysis to assess the sentiment of the tweets that were sent. However, this approach may be inadequate because sports fans may be unlikely to mention a corporate sponsor in the text they tweet. This study demonstrates the use of visual analytics to assess conversations about corporate sponsors by examining the images people tweet."
w,"In the context of a fast aging population and of its increasing need for healthcare and assistance, ubiquitous usage of Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart applications can mitigate the consequential social burden. Connected sensors and devices inside the seniors' home produce a significant amount of data about them and their daily activities. IoT and Big Data Analytics (BDA) are an important mean to derive knowledge and support for improving the life conditions for the older adults by increasing the role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for accomplish this goal. IoT analytics can aid in personalizing applications that benefit both elderly people and the ever-growing industries that need adapt their offer to the consumer's profiles. This paper presents a new platform that enables innovative analytics on IoT captured data from smart residences of elderly people. A solution based on the use of fog nodes and cloud system is suggested in order to afford data-driven services and to manage the complexity and provision of the necessary resources for online and offline data processing, storage, and analysis. The requirements and the design of the platform architecture are underlined. We propose an architecture of a platform based on fog computing nodes coupled with cloud computing that offers an efficient near real time processing of the big data resulted from IoT system that provides insights and data processing and analysis facilities into cloud. This integrated design has an important impact on time sensitive applications by addressing the latency issues of cloud."
w,"Predictive analytics can be used to identify people with HIV currently retained in care who are at risk for future disengagement from care, allowing for prioritization of retention interventions. We utilized machine learning methods to develop predictive models of retention in care, defined as no more than a 12 month gap between HIV care appointments in the Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) cohort. Data were split longitudinally into derivation and validation cohorts. We created logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and gradient boosted machine (XGB) models within a discrete-time survival analysis framework and compared their performance to a baseline model that included only demographics, viral suppression, and retention history. 21,267 Patients with 507,687 visits from 2007 to 2018 were included. The LR model outperformed the baseline model (AUC 0.68 [0.67-0.70] vs. 0.60 [0.59-0.62], P < 0.001). RF and XGB models had similar performance to the LR model. Top features in the LR model included retention history, age, and viral suppression."
w,"Some results of Data Mining of scientific publication activity in Scopus database and Text Big Data analytics using API access to Google about Information transformation are presented. The whole ecosystem of Internet of Health and its place within Internet of Things are described. System analysis is given about: Big Data market in Health Care, ways of Medical Information Systems development, and the direction of hospitals transition to new condition based on three whales (hybrid Cloud computing, supercomputer and data center). The Internet of Things ecosystem foregrounds some important aspects related to gerontology, genetics, biorhythmology, and gravitational biology. Sociological understanding of people's role in formation of the new high IT dependence reality allows to determine the main vectors of farsighted forecast. The technological evolution can be described as subsequent stages: distribution of IT - automation - Digital transformation and Internet of Things - Big Data analytics Artificial Intelligence solutions - people connection to Augmented Reality - Context-as-A-Service - NBIC- and GRAIN-technologies - Humanity Plus. The essence of concept patient is changing. Patient transforms into an e-patient (all records about patient have been digitized) and then into Internet-patient with monitoring of health parameters within the Internet of Things surrounding people. Getting Augmented Reality patient is becoming a Digital patient. Augmented Reality methods are already being developed to treat patients. Medicine as part of social structure becomes more diffuse, covering common space of Internet of Things. Medical culture acquires a new value for society. Five measures for successful transformation of Health Care in Russia are recommended in the article."
w,"Background: Although the potential of big data analytics for health care is well recognized, evidence is lacking on its effects on public health. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the use of big data analytics on people's health based on the health indicators and core priorities in the World Health Organization (WHO) General Programme of Work 2019/2023 and the European Programme of Work (EPW), approved and adopted by its Member States, in addition to SARS-CoV-2-related studies. Furthermore, we sought to identify the most relevant challenges and opportunities of these tools with respect to people's health. Methods: Six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Epistemonikos) were searched from the inception date to September 21, 2020. Systematic reviews assessing the effects of big data analytics on health indicators were included. Two authors independently performed screening, selection, data extraction, and quality assessment using the AMSTAR-2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2) checklist. Results: The literature search initially yielded 185 records, 35 of which met the inclusion criteria, involving more than 5,000,000 patients. Most of the included studies used patient data collected from electronic health records, hospital information systems, private patient databases, and imaging datasets, and involved the use of big data analytics for noncommunicable diseases. Probability of dying from any of cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes or chronic renal disease and suicide mortality rate were the most commonly assessed health indicators and core priorities within the WHO General Programme of Work 2019/2023 and the EPW 2020/2025. Big data analytics have shown moderate to high accuracy for the diagnosis and prediction of complications of diabetes mellitus as well as for the diagnosis and classification of mental disorders; prediction of suicide attempts and behaviors; and the diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of important clinical outcomes of several chronic diseases. Confidence in the results was rated as critically low for 25 reviews, as low for 7 reviews, and as moderate for 3 reviews. The most frequently identified challenges were establishment of a well-designed and structured data source, and a secure, transparent, and standardized database for patient data. Conclusions: Although the overall quality of included studies was limited, big data analytics has shown moderate to high accuracy for the diagnosis of certain diseases, improvement in managing chronic diseases, and support for prompt and real-time analyses of large sets of varied input data to diagnose and predict disease outcomes."
w,"Cross-data analytics and retrieval have gained significant improvement recently. People can now extract more data insights precisely and quickly towards having many excellent applications serving human lives. Since people create multimedia and other types of data that reflect the diverse perspectives of human lives, these data are just pieces of the puzzle of the world's pictures. Hence, it is necessary to assembly all these pieces towards having a better solution for human-centered problems. Hence, the workshop welcomes those who work with multimedia and others and come from diverse research domains and disciplines to work on intelligent cross-data analytics and retrieval to bring a smart, sustainable society to human beings. The research domain can vary fromwell-being, disaster prevention and mitigation, mobility to food computing, to name a few."
w,"Immersive Analytics is a new research initiative that aims to remove barriers between people, their data and the tools they use for analysis and decision making. Here we clarify the aims of immersive analytics research, its opportunities and historical context, as well as providing a broad research agenda for the field. In addition, we review how the term immersion has been used to refer to both technological and psychological immersion, both of which are central to immersive analytics research."
w,"Background: Digital health in hospital settings is viewed as a panacea for achieving the quadruple aim of health care, yet the outcomes have been largely inconclusive. To optimize digital health outcomes, a strategic approach is necessary, requiring digital maturity assessments. However, current approaches to assessing digital maturity have been largely insufficient, with uncertainty surrounding the dimensions to assess. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the current dimensions used to assess the digital maturity of hospitals. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted of peer-reviewed literature (published before December 2020) investigating maturity models used to assess the digital maturity of hospitals. A total of 29 relevant articles were retrieved, representing 27 distinct maturity models. The articles were inductively analyzed, and the maturity model dimensions were extracted and consolidated into a maturity model framework. Results: The consolidated maturity model framework consisted of 7 dimensions: strategy; information technology capability; interoperability; governance and management; patient-centered care; people, skills, and behavior; and data analytics. These 7 dimensions can be evaluated based on 24 respective indicators. Conclusions: The maturity model framework developed for this study can be used to assess digital maturity and identify areas for improvement."
w,"The important aspect of information gathering is to know what people think about particular topic. With the growth of IT and Internet, resource of opinion-rich text goes on increasing and thus the importance of text classification is increased in order to determine opinion about a subject. The main goal of sentiment analysis is to define sentiment or polarity of a sentence or a piece of text. Polarity means to check whether a particular piece text is positive, negative or neutral. The goal is to extract useful data and present it in a clear way so that one can get a general idea about people's opinions. While doing Text analytics on posts or tweets obtained from social networking site, along with text some useful information is available know as Side Data. Such side data may be found in the form of access behavior of user from web logs, referred links to sites, special symbols, emotions, etc. This side data is helpful in predicting the polarity of the text. Further, the process of classification can be done using SparkR to improve processing speed and to analyze huge amount of data."
w,"Carpooling, i.e., the act where two or more travelers share the same car for a common trip, is one of the possibilities brought forward to reduce traffic and its externalities, but experience shows that it is difficult to boost the adoption of carpooling to significant levels. In our study, we analyze the potential impact of carpooling as a collective phenomenon emerging from people's mobility, by network analytics. Based on big mobility data from travelers in a given territory, we construct the network of potential carpooling, where nodes correspond to the users and links to possible shared trips, and analyze the structural and topological properties of this network, such as network communities and node ranking, to the purpose of highlighting the subpopulations with higher chances to create a carpooling community, and the propensity of users to be either drivers or passengers in a shared car. Our study is anchored to reality thanks to a large mobility dataset, consisting of the complete one-month-long GPS trajectories of approx. 10% circulating cars in Tuscany. We also analyze the aggregated outcome of carpooling by means of empirical simulations, showing how an assignment policy exploiting the network analytic concepts of communities and node rankings minimizes the number of single occupancy vehicles observed after carpooling.

w,"We have entered the big data era. Organizations are capturing, storing, and analyzing data that has high volume, velocity, and variety and comes from a variety of new sources, including social media, machines, log files, video, text, image, RFID, and GPS. These sources have strained the capabilities of traditional relational database management systems and spawned a host of new technologies, approaches, and platforms. The potential value of big data analytics is great and is clearly established by a growing number of studies. The keys to success with big data analytics include a clear business need, strong committed sponsorship, alignment between the business and IT strategies, a fact-based decision-making culture, a strong data infrastructure, the right analytical tools, and people skilled in the use of analytics. Because of the paradigm shift in the kinds of data being analyzed and how this data is used, big data can be considered to be a new, fourth generation of decision support data management. Though the business value from big data is great, especially for online companies like Google and Facebook, how it is being used is raising significant privacy concerns."
w,"The growing number of social media users and vast volume of posts could provide valuable information about the sentiment toward different locations, services as well as people. Recent advances in Big Data analytics and natural language processing often means to automatically calculate sentiment in these posts. Sentiment analysis is challenging and computationally demanding task due to the volume of data, misspelling, emoticons as well as abbreviations. While significant work was directed toward the sentiment analysis of English text there is limited attention in literature toward the sentiment analytic of Chinese language. In this work we propose method to identify the sentiment in Chinese social media posts and to test our method we rely on posts sent by visitors of Great Barrier Reef by users of most popular Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo. We elaborate process of capturing of weibo posts, describe a creation of lexicon as well as develop and explain algorithm for sentiment calculation. In case study, related to sentiment toward the different GBR destinations, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in obtaining the information and is suitable to monitor visitors' opinion."
w,"The advances of location-acquisition technologies and rapid development of GPS equipped devices have generated large spatio-temporal mobility traces fostering the opportunity of discovering inherent knowledge about urban dynamics. This mobility analytics of the movement behaviours of people and vehicles is the key component of building any intelligent transportation system (ITS) application. However, extracting usable knowledge from huge volume of mobility data is both time-consuming and computationally intensive. In this work, we propose a cloud-based spatial trajectory trace management framework, namely, Traj-Cloud to effectively store, retrieve and efficiently process the mobility traces for real-time applications. Traj-Cloud is a SaaS cloud which provides three major mobility services, namely, (i) trajectory-indexing to efficiently handle huge real-time trajectory updates; (ii) geo-tagging, map-matching services in a distributed computing platform (i.e., Google Compute Engine) and (iii) trajectory-processing to resolve mobility based spatio-temporal queries to improve efficiency and reduce response time. Traj-Cloud has been implemented in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and empirical results on real-life dataset of NYC taxi traces and mobility trajectories of an academic campus yields the effectiveness of the proposed framework."
w,"Modern security cameras are capable of capturing high-resolution HD or 4K videos and support embedded analytics capable of automatically tracking objects such as people and cars moving through the scene. However, due to a lack of computational power on these cameras, the embedded video analytics cannot utilize the full available video resolution, severely limiting the range at which they can detect objects. We present a technique for scale correction, leveraging approximate camera calibration information, that uses high image resolutions in parts of the frame that are far from the camera and lower image resolution in parts of the frame that are closer to the camera. Existing background models can run on the proposed scale-normalized high-resolution (1280x720) video frame for a similar computational cost as an unnormalized 640x360 frame. Our proposed scale correction technique also improves object-level precision and recall."
w,"With the existence and growth of Social Network Services (SNS), they have become focus in data and image processing research and concerning their potential to describe persons based on online available information. In this paper we propose a novel approach for person profiling solely based on images for children and adolescents of age 10+. The application acquires pictures from search engines and SNS and performs image-based analysis focusing on facial attributes. Image analysis results using different image datasets are presented showing that image analytics faces challenges of its application unconstrained datasets, but has the potential to push SNS analytics to a new level of detail in people profiling. The applications aims at improving the target users' media literacy, raising their awareness for risks and consequences and at encouraging them in dealing responsibly with pictures online."
w,"The study explores the gendered institutional practices and rationalities applied to young people placed in Danish secure institutions. The study draws on ethnographic research, combining participant observation and interviews to gain insight into professionals' gendered practices and rationalities, and young people's experiences of confinement. Drawing on Foucauldian power analytics and post-structuralist feminist theory on subjectivity, the study finds that the disciplining practices are gendered to promote working-class masculinity for boys and normative femininity and (hetero)sexuality for girls, with minorizing effects on some boys and girls. The study provides unique insights from a gender-integrated context for confined young people and supplements scholarship on the gendered logics that underpin interventions operating within the penal-social work nexus."
w,"New spatial data sources are emerging that have attributes of big data. These sources challenge our ability to handle high degrees of velocity, volume, and variety, and also frequently include a wide range of attributes that stretch our ability to characterize their veracity. While it remains quite challenging to visually represent, interact with, and reason about these data, our focus in this work is to suggest what analysts may be able to learn from the gaps in what we measure or the absences suggested by certain attributes. Put simply, we need to know more about how to show the missingness and absence in spatial data and to understand how people reason with that type of information in geovisual analytics environments."
w,"The present article continues the cycle of the cognitive researches of the phenomenon of social cohesion in education, in particular, in the university communities. It contains the cognitive research of trust and its foundation as the central focus of social cohesion. The purpose of the study is to identify the level of trust which is connected with the social cohesion in university communities, to test the author's questionnaire and to determinate the further steps for the trust enhancement in the educational community. Methods that were used in the study are the author's questionnaire, math analytics etc. There were 196 people interviewed in both universities, among them 31 employees and 85 students of the National Pedagogical Dragomanov University and 33 employees and 47 students of the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine. According to the research results, the level of trust in each university community (as well as in common) was average, excluding some indicators. Although there were some differences between levels of trust of employees of these universities. We can assume that the quite sufficient average level or trust positively characterizes the attitude of employees and students to each other, reflects their readiness for mutual respect and support, acceptance of differences and tolerance etc. Also, the research highlights weak points of social interactions that form the base for further investigations and actions on the social cohesion development.

w,"Can we measure and predict character with predictive analytics so a business can better assess, ideally objectively, whether to lend money or extend credit to that person, beyond current objective measures of credit scores (when available) and standard financial metrics like solvency and debt ratios? We and the analysts probably do not know enough about character to try to measure it, though it might be more useful to measure and predict a person's temperance and prudence as virtues, or self-control as psychology, or sense of obligation, particularly a moral commitment or sense of duty to honor a contract and re-pay a loan. The pervasive data surveillance of people that goes with big data and predictive analytics is not only an invasion of privacy in general, but an impairment of the aspect of privacy called autonomy that will constrict and alter a person's choices and development of self."
w,"The paper focuses on the goals' achievements of the Strategy of economic and social development of St. Petersburg until 2030. Strategic directions of St. Petersburg development until 2030 (human capital development, improving urban environment, providing sustainable economic growth, ensuring effective governance and civil society development) are examined. The feasibility of economic and social development indicators, predicted in 2012 for 2020 and 2030, is verified on the basis of actual data for 2016. The indicators, predicted values of which are hard-to-reach and require revision, are revealed. Such indicators, according to the predictive analytics, are: employed in economy, percent of people with higher education, workplaces with high labor productivity and foreign investment in economy of St. Petersburg. The paper examines the dynamics of the main indicators presented by the Committee for Economic Policy and Strategic Planning of St. Petersburg on the basis of predictive analytics. The list of indicators is not exhaustive. The Strategy is based on the UN sustainable development goals and one of its scenarios has prospects for implementation."
w,"The Berkeley AMPLab is creating a new approach to data analytics. Launching in early 2011, the lab aims to seamlessly integrate the three main resources available for making sense of data at scale: Algorithms (machine learning and statistical techniques), Machines (in the form of scalable clusters and elastic cloud computing), and People (both individually as analysts and in crowds). The lab is realizing its ideas through the development of a freely-available Open Source software stack called BDAS: the Berkeley Data Analytics Stack. In the four years the lab has been in operation, we've released major components of BDAS. Several of these components have gained significant traction in industry and elsewhere: the Mesos cluster resource manager, the Spark in-memory computation framework, and the Shark query processing system. BDAS features prominently in many industry discussions of the future of the Big Data analytics ecosystem - a rare degree of impact for an ongoing academic project. Given this initial success, the lab is continuing on its research path, moving up the stack to better integrate and support advanced analytics and to make people a full-fledged resource for making sense of data. In this talk, I'll first outline the motivation and insights behind our research approach and describe how we have organized to address the cross-disciplinary nature of Big Data challenges. I will then describe the current state of BDAS with an emphasis on our newest efforts, including some or all of: the GraphX graph processing system, the Velox and MLBase machine learning platforms, and the SampleClean framework for hybrid human/computer data cleaning. Finally I will present our current views of how all the pieces will fit together to form a system that can adaptively bring the right resources to bear on a given data-driven question to meet time, cost and quality requirements throughout the analytics lifecycle."
w,"Aggressive, unexpected, and catastrophic changes in the environment-induced or impacted by the cultivation of land, crops, and cattle are known as agricultural disasters. In agriculture, the volume of data unpredictability, processing, and data management standards for interoperability are significant concerns. While natural catas-trophes are still a considerable problem, the enormous amount of data available has opened up new avenues for coping. Accordingly, big data analytics has profoundly changed the way people respond to disasters in the agriculture sector. In this paper, the Data handling model using big data analytics (DHM-BDA)explores the role of big data in managing agricultural disasters and highlights the technical status of delivering practical and efficient disaster management solutions. DHM-BDA is used to address the essential sources of big data that include climatic causes and associated successes and developing technological problems in different disaster management phases. In addition, it aids in the monitoring, mitigation, alleviation, and acceptance of agricultural catastrophes and the process of recovery and rebuilding. The simulation findings have been executed, and the suggested model enhances the prediction ratio of 98.9%, decision-making level of 97.8%, data management of 96.5%, production ratio of 95.6%, and risk reduction ratio of 97.1% compared to other existing approaches."
w,"Background Sub-Saharan African HIV programs have had limited success in engaging men. Crowdsourcing contests may be a useful method to spur men's engagement in HIV services. We evaluated contributions and social media response to a crowdsourcing contest focused on increasing men's engagement in Eswatini HIV services. Methods We conducted a crowdsourcing contest to gain insight from the public on how HIV campaigns can more effectively engage young (20-40 years old) men in HIV services. Eligible submissions included images, songs, videos, and Internet memes. We used standard qualitative methods to examine textual themes from submissions. We examined social media response using Facebook analytics, comparing the number of people reached through crowdsourced HIV messages and the number of people reached through conventional HIV messages. Results We received 144 submissions from 83 participants. They represented 55 towns and all 4 regions of Eswatini. The contest page gained 461 followers on Facebook. Emergent themes included appealing to men's roles as protectors by suggesting that they need to take care of their own health to continue safeguarding their families. Crowdsourced messages reached a mean of 88 individuals across 4 posts; conventional messages reached a mean of 75 individuals across 4 posts. Conclusions Crowdsourcing contest submissions provided insight on how to encourage men to engage in Eswatini HIV services. Crowdsourcing contests can be effective in collecting messages from men to create more locally relevant communication materials for HIV programs."

However, to extract value from data, we need to apply specific methods of cleaning and prepossessing it. In this paper, we observe the problem of geospatial data de-duplication, propose and implement end-to-end solutions for social-media-based data de-duplication. We apply advanced geospatial, natural language processing, and classical machine learning methods for our solution. Our tool shows high competitiveness in observed competition and can process a vast amount of data with limited computational resources."
w,"With the advancement in video processing technologies, we can capture subtle human responses in a retail store environment which play decisive role in the store management. In this paper, we present a novel surveillance video based analytic system for retail stores targeting localized and global traffic estimate. Development of an intelligent system for human traffic estimation in real-life poses a challenging problem because of the variation and noise involved. In this direction, we begin with a novel human tracking system by an intelligent combination of motion based and image level object detection. We demonstrate the initial evaluation of this approach on available standard dataset yielding promising result. Exact traffic estimate in a retail store require correct separation of customers from service providers. We present a role based human classification framework using Gaussian mixture model for this task. A novel feature descriptor named graded colour histogram is defined for object representation. Using, our role based human classification and tracking system, we have defined a novel computationally efficient framework for two types of analytics generation i.e., region specific people count and dwell-time estimation. This system has been extensively evaluated and tested on four hours of real-life video captured from a retail store."

Results are very encouraging for DBSCAN but less useful for k-means."
w,"The unprecedented availability of social media data offers substantial opportunities for data owners, system operators, solution providers, and end users to explore and understand social dynamics. However, the exponential growth in the volume, velocity, and variability of social media data prevents people from fully utilizing such data. Visual analytics, which is an emerging research direction, has received considerable attention in recent years. Many visual analytics methods have been proposed across disciplines to understand large-scale structured and unstructured social media data. This objective, however, also poses significant challenges for researchers to obtain a comprehensive picture of the area, understand research challenges, and develop new techniques. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey to characterize this fast-growing area and summarize the state-of-the-art techniques for analyzing social media data. In particular, we classify existing techniques into two categories: gathering information and understanding user behaviors. We aim to provide a clear overview of the research area through the established taxonomy. We then explore the design space and identify the research trends. Finally, we discuss challenges and open questions for future studies."
w,"Since 2000, the Internet has become a primary advertising and marketing channel for businesses. With the recent advance of mobile computing and wireless networking, mobile advertising is now becoming popular because mobile devices provide an effective advertising platform. People today believe that big data analytics provides new opportunities and needs for advertisers. However, most existing advertisement solutions primarily use Behavior Targeting (BT) technology to provide static services, which cannot satisfy the real-time, fast big data processing requirements. The purpose of this project is to develop a new big data analytics service in advertising and marketing based on emergent big data technologies, data mining algorithms, and machine learning solutions. The primary objective of this project is to provide real-time and static on demand services for advertisers and publishers to decide when, what, where, who, and how to place advertisements. In addition, this project requires solutions to analyze the collected big advertising data, discover customers behavior patterns, and establish an innovative model for advertising recommendation and trend prediction. The system will be developed based on advanced machine learning and data mining algorithms, NoSQL database technologies, and visualization techniques. This service will allow advertisers and publishers to reduce their costs while improving their effectiveness."
w,"In practice, end-to-end data analysis is rarely a cleanly engineered process. Acquiring data can be tricky. Data assessment, wrangling and feature extraction are time-consuming and subjective. Models and algorithms used to derive data products are highly contextualized by time-varying properties of data sources, code and application needs. All of these issues would ideally benefit from an organizational view, but are often driven by individual users. Viewed holistically, both agile analytics and the establishment of analytic pipelines involve interactions between people, computation and infrastructure. In this talk I'll share some anecdotes from our research, user studies, and field experience with companies (Trifacta, Captricity), as well as an emerging open-source project (Ground)."
w,"Smart spaces have become an integral part of our daily routines to improve quality of life for many different groups of people. The use of embedded systems to build these smart spaces, in combination with data analytics, can provide real-time information about the environment and how it interacts with the people in it. In this paper, we demonstrate how one embedded system that acquires data based on a 2-dimensional positional-grid, movement, temperature and vibration is used to build a smart and pervasive space. Data collected from these sensors is used for real time localization in conjunction with machine learning mechanisms to analyze human activities. We evaluate five machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Artificial Neural Network applied on a dataset collected in our lab. Results show high classification performance for all methods giving up-to 99.95% classification accuracy. These patterns provide useful information about occupancy patterns, movement patterns, etc., which will be later used to allocate computational resources in the smart space accordingly. Furthermore, our implementation does not use any camera or microphone deployment, hence addressing potential privacy issues."

w,"Researchers and practitioners increasingly believe that journalism must improve its relationship with audiences to increase the likelihood that people will consume and support news. In this paper, we argue that this assumption overlooks the importance of structural- and individual-level factors in shaping news audience behavior. Drawing on Giddens' theory of structuration, we suggest that, when it comes to the amount of time that people devote to news, consumers' choices are guided more by life circumstances than by news preferences. To illustrate this point, we draw on a combination of interview and audience analytics data collected when so many people's life circumstances changed: the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that people consumed more news during the early months of the pandemic than normal because (1) they had more time on their hands due to things like shelter-in-place orders, layoffs, and shifts to working from home and (2) they were more interested in understanding the coronavirus' spread and risks as well as the preventative measures being pursued. We conclude that journalists should embrace journalistic humility, thereby acknowledging and accepting that they have much less control over the reception of their work than they would like to believe."
w,"With the development of technology and connectivity, it is has become easier to gather data regarding a necessity, and use that to analyze, observe and provide solutions to day-to-day problems. The development of science and technology has brought immense benefit and comfort to human society allowing us to venture further with ease. The same applies to Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), the system that measures the medical parameters of a human subject to treat his or her ailments. The data gathered from various patients can be collected and provided to the medical authority and doctors accordingly. This is used to generate patterns from a definitive source and provide clarity of the patient's disease and/or any condition to the doctors. However, doing that for many patients and hospital records requires an immense amount of time and people. This is where big data analytics comes into play, a cloud based analytics technology that scans extraordinarily large amounts of data, identifies similarities and differences, and observes the patterns to help doctors solve their patients' diseases or conditions. Using this technology prevents unnecessary deaths of patients. This paper will explain the implementation process of big data analytics in large scale WBAN, the difficulties and challenges that may occur, and its applications and benefits."
w,Big Data analytics is basically theprocess of analyzing and mining of Big Data which can produce business and operational knowledge at an unprecedented specificity and scale. The paper focuses on the applications and challenges of Big Data Analytics in the healthcare industry. The requirement of analyzing and leveraging clinical data collected by different sources is one of the crucial drivers for Big Data analysis tools in the healthcare industry. The Big Data Analytics plays a crucial role in improving the health conditions of the people and prevents them from major medical issues when used wisely.
w,"Person re-identification is one of the most important and challenging problems in video analytics systems; it aims to match people across non-overlapping camera views. For person re-identification, metric learning is introduced to improve the performance by providing a metric adapted for cross-view matching. The essence of metric learning is to search for an optimal projection matrix to project the original features into a new feature space. However, most existing metric learning methods overlook the inconsistency of feature distributions in multiple cameras. In this paper, we propose a multi-projection metric learning (MPML) method to overcome the inconsistency among multiple cameras in person re-identification. Our solution is to jointly learn multiple projection matrices using paired samples from different cameras to project features from different cameras into a common feature space. To make our method adaptive to newly added cameras without affecting the learned projection matrices, we further propose an adaptive MPML method, which can learn new camera projection matrices without having to update any of the obtained projection matrices. The proposed methods are evaluated on four major person re-identification data sets, with comprehensive experiments showing the effectiveness of the proposed methods and notable improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches."
w,"The collective effervescence of social media production has been enjoying a great deal of success in recent years. The hundred of millions of users who are actively participating in the Social Web are exposed to ever-growing amounts of sites, relationships, and information. In this paper, we report part of the efforts towards the realization of a Web Observatory at the L3S Research Center (www.L3S.de). In particular, we present our approach based on Living Analytics methods, whose main goal is to capture people interactions in real-time and to analyze multidimensional relationships, metadata, and other data becoming ubiquitous in the social web, in order to discover the most relevant and attractive information to support observation, understanding and analysis of the Web. We center the discussion on two areas: (i) Recommender Systems for Big Fast Data and (ii) Collective Intelligence, both key components towards an analytics toolbox for our Web Observatory."
w,"In a networked video surveillance system, the videos collected from different surveillance cameras are stored in a centralized server. These videos can be made available for scrutiny, during an event of security threat. Real time analysis of these surveillance videos can be helpful in preventing crimes in the areas under surveillance. A major challenge in video analytics is object detection from video frames. Identifying people in the videos has many applications like handling security through surveillance cameras, crime detection, personalized assistance for the needy, product purchase promotion, employee monitoring, etc. Accurate person re-identification from videos has huge potential that can revolutionize the way businesses work today. This paper discusses a method for person re-identification from the videos collected from surveillance cameras. The critical tasks in this process are face detection from videos and prediction of persons using Convolutional Neural Network models developed using the cropped face images from the face detection stage."
w,"This paper explains an application of big data analytics to detect illegitimate transactions performed by fraudulent communities of people who are engaged in a notorious tax evasion practice called circular trading. We designed and implemented this technique for the commercial taxes department, government of Telangana, India. This problem is solved in two steps. In step one, the problem is formulated as detecting fraudulent communities in a social network, where the vertices correspond to dealers and edges correspond to sales transactions. In step two, specific type of cycles are removed from each fraudulent community, which were identified in step one, to detect the illegitimate transactions. We used RHadoop framework for implementing this technique."
w,"Immersive Analytics (IA) uses immersive virtual and augmented reality displays for data visualization and visual analytics. Designers rely on studies of how accurately people interpret data in different visualizations to make effective visualization choices. However, these studies focus on data analysis in traditional desktop environments. We lack empirical grounding for how to best visualize data in immersive environments. This study explores how people interpret data visualizations across different display types by measuring how quickly and accurately people conduct three analysis tasks over five visual channels: color, size, height, orientation, and depth. We identify key quantitative differences in performance and user behavior, indicating that stereo viewing resolves some of the challenges of visualizations in 3D space. We also find that while AR displays encourage increased navigation, they decrease performance with color-based visualizations. Our results provide guidelines on how to tailor visualizations to different displays in order to better leverage the affordances of IA modalities."
w,"There has been a recent increase in debates on the ethics of social media research, passive sensor data collection, and big data analytics. However, little evidence exists to describe how people experience and understand these applications of technology. This study aimed to passively collect data from mobile phone sensors, lapel cameras, and Bluetooth beacons to assess people's understanding and acceptance of these technologies. Seven households were purposefully sampled and data collected for 10 days. The study generated 48 hr of audio data and 30,000 images. After participant review, the data were destroyed and in-depth interviews conducted. Participants found the data collected acceptable and reported willingness to participate in similar studies. Key risks included that the camera could capture nudity and sex acts, but family review of footage before sharing helped reduce concerns. The Emanuel et al. ethics framework was found to accommodate the concerns and perspectives of study participants."
w,"Data analysis originated from social media presents huge interest among researchers and practitioners. In order to understand better and clarify notions and methodologies used regarding social media analytics, a framework is needed with clear classification schemes and procedures. The objective of this paper is to develop a unified framework that clusters the possible categories of data and their interactions. Furthermore, the proposed framework indicates the procedures that have to be followed in order to achieve the most optimized choice of social media analytics (SMA) methodology, initiating the 4P's procedure (People, Purpose, Platform, and Process). Next, the methodologies used on SMA, in specific the structural and content-based analysis, as well as their sub-methodologies (community and influencers' detection, NLP, text, sentiment, and geospatial analysis) are indicated. The proposed framework will facilitate researchers and marketers on the decision-making process by clarifying each step, regarding the objectives, the involved parties, the social media platform, and the analysis process that can be chosen."
w,"Under the vigorous development of global anticipatory computing in recent years, there have been numerous applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in people's daily lives. Learning analytics of big data can assist students, teachers, and school administrators to gain new knowledge and estimate learning information; in turn, the enhanced education contributes to the rapid development of science and technology. Education is sustainable life learning, as well as the most important promoter of science and technology worldwide. In recent years, a large number of anticipatory computing applications based on AI have promoted the training professional AI talent. As a result, this study aims to design a set of interactive robot-assisted teaching for classroom setting to help students overcoming academic difficulties. Teachers, students, and robots in the classroom can interact with each other through the ARCS motivation model in programming. The proposed method can help students to develop the motivation, relevance, and confidence in learning, thus enhancing their learning effectiveness. The robot, like a teaching assistant, can help students solving problems in the classroom by answering questions and evaluating students' answers in natural and responsive interactions. The natural interactive responses of the robot are achieved through the use of a database of emotional big data (Google facial expression comparison dataset). The robot is loaded with an emotion recognition system to assess the moods of the students through their expressions and sounds, and then offer corresponding emotional responses. The robot is able to communicate naturally with the students, thereby attracting their attention, triggering their learning motivation, and improving their learning effectiveness."
w,"Industry 4.0 and digitalization are common themes in aluminium producers' strategies. However, the actual penetration of such applications varies and there is a lack of common terminology. In this article, we first establish a framework around different types of applications seen in the aluminium industry, specifically the carbon area, consisting of: (1) Measuring and managing data (2) Sensing and diagnosing (3) Simulating and creating a twin (4) Automatic process optimization (5) Robotics and autonomous operation. We then review what we see currently existing in the market, discussing some of the early implementations of optimization products through anode and rod tracking, and presenting what we currently see under development both within Metso Outotec aluminium and amongst our peers, such as other technology vendors and producers' in-house technology departments. Currently, there are four interesting avenues emerging: (1) Advanced process simulations enabling effective debottlenecking, e.g., in the rod shop (2) Continued development of overall process optimization in the carbon area, using data sensors and analytics to further optimize anode quality. Still missing, though, is the critical real-time feedback loop from potlines (3) Predictive maintenance applications particularly for equipment-intensive areas such as the rodshop or vibrocompactors. (4) Increased autonomous operations, reducing the need for manual labour in hazardous areas. All of these have their base in understanding which process parameters need monitoring, and hence which sensors should be installed. In addition, embarking on this journey requires certain investments into analytics capabilities, i.e., people and/or software which are able to do the necessary number crunching. In summary, we believe digitalization is starting to make great strides in the industry at the moment. Hindering this movement, however, is still a conservative mindset approach from the industry particularly in new greenfield investments-where arguably adding new features would be far easier than when doing retrofits. We'd encourage more cooperation between technology vendors, EPCMs, and aluminium producers to work together in this field."
w,"Collaborative usage and development of models is an interesting challenge for modern organizations. While models play a decisive role in the planning, analytics and execution of many processes, active involvement of people other than modeling experts in creating or using models beyond providing information and being queried about the fit of models to their work is rare in practice. This article creates a context for collaborative model usage and development by describing its benefits, its origins and existing work on the topic. It also presents a taxonomy of existing approaches to support collaborative model usage and development and elaborates on research needs and challenges to be overcome in order to establish it as common practice in organizations. It then builds a bridge to the three contributions in this Special Issue, which describe cutting edge and unique research on these needs and challenges."
w,"People's trust in prediction models can be affected by many factors, including domain expertise like knowledge about the application domain and experience with predictive modelling. However, to what extent and why domain expertise impacts people's trust is not entirely clear. In addition, accurately measuring people's trust remains challenging. We share our results and experiences of an exploratory pilot study in which four people experienced with predictive modelling systematically explore a visual analytics system with an unknown prediction model. Through a mixed-methods approach involving Likert-type questions and a semi-structured interview, we investigate how people's trust evolves during their exploration, and we distil six themes that affect their trust in the prediction model. Our results underline the multi-faceted nature of trust, and suggest that domain expertise alone cannot fully predict people's trust perceptions."

w,"Purpose - Dave Snowden has been an important voice in knowledge management over the years. As the founder and chief scientific officer of Cognitive Edge, a company focused on the development of the theory and practice of social complexity, he offers informative views on the relationship between big data/analytics and KM. Design/methodology/approach - A face-to-face interview was held with Dave Snowden in May 2015 in Auckland, New Zealand. Findings - According to Snowden, analytics in the form of algorithms are imperfect and can only to a small extent capture the reasoning and analytical capabilities of people. For this reason, while big data/analytics can be useful, they are limited and must be used in conjunction with human knowledge and reasoning. Practical implications - Snowden offers his views on big data/analytics and how they can be used effectively in real world situations in combination with human reasoning and input, for example in fields from resource management to individual health care. Originality/value - Snowden is an innovative thinker. He combines knowledge and experience from many fields and offers original views and understanding of big data/analytics, knowledge and management."
w,"With the rapid development of the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and big data, more comprehensive and powerful applications become available. Meanwhile, people pay more attention to higher QoE and QoS in a terminal-cloud integrated system. Specifically, both advanced terminal technologies (e.g., smart clothing) and advanced cloud technologies (e.g., big data analytics and cognitive computing in clouds) are expected to provide people with more reliable and intelligent services. Therefore, in this article we propose a Wearable 2.0 healthcare system to improve QoE and QoS of the next generation healthcare system. In the proposed system, washable smart clothing, which consists of sensors, electrodes, and wires, is the critical component to collect users' physiological data and receive the analysis results of users' health and emotional status provided by cloud-based machine intelligence."
w,"Background and ObjectivesThe relationship between COVID-19 and epilepsy is uncertain. We studied the potential association between COVID-19 and seizures or epilepsy in the 6 months after infection.MethodsWe applied validated methods to an electronic health records network (TriNetX Analytics) of 81 million people. We closely matched people with COVID-19 infections to those with influenza. In each cohort, we measured the incidence and hazard ratios (HRs) of seizures and epilepsy. We stratified data by age and by whether the person was hospitalized during the acute infection. We then explored time-varying HRs to assess temporal patterns of seizure or epilepsy diagnoses.ResultsWe analyzed 860,934 electronic health records. After matching, this yielded 2 cohorts each of 152,754 patients. COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of seizures and epilepsy compared with influenza. The incidence of seizures within 6 months of COVID-19 was 0.81% (95% CI 0.75-0.88; HR compared with influenza 1.55 [1.39-1.74]). The incidence of epilepsy was 0.30% (0.26-0.34; HR compared with influenza 1.87 [1.54-2.28]). The HR of epilepsy after COVID-19 compared with influenza was greater in people who had not been hospitalized and in individuals younger than 16 years. The time of peak HR after infection differed by age and hospitalization status.DiscussionThe incidence of new seizures or epilepsy diagnoses in the 6 months after COVID-19 was low overall, but higher than in matched patients with influenza. This difference was more marked in people who were not hospitalized, highlighting the risk of epilepsy and seizures even in those with less severe infection. Children appear at particular risk of seizures and epilepsy after COVID-19 providing another motivation to prevent COVID-19 infection in pediatric populations. That the varying time of peak risk related to hospitalization and age may provide clues as to the underlying mechanisms of COVID-associated seizures and epilepsy."
w,"The original Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) model was developed in the early 90's, with revisits in 1998, and 2004. Today, with new technologies of big data, cloud computing, and machine analytics, there is an ever increasing need for integration of people and machines. The original JDL model focused on the data fusion (correlation, filtering, and association) issues, while today there is an increasing emphasis on an integrated approach to information exploitation over sensors, users, and missions using enterprise architectures, interoperability standards, and intelligence to the edge. Given these recent changes to computation and distributed access, we examine ways for extending the JDL model from 1998 to support exploitation functions and information management for situation awareness, massive data analytics for contextual awareness, and domain-specific needs for mission awareness."
w,"People suffering from Developmental-Disabilities are almost entirely paralyzed disabling them to communicate in any way except using an Augmentative and Alternative Communication device. Survey analysis tells that 1.4% of globe's population suffers from speech disorder which is more than the Karnataka's population. Looking into the elderly group it was analyzed that the fall events cannot be predicted and might be an unsafe event. Estimates tell that 33.33% of 65 and above aged people fall every year. It can be seen that out of these falls 55% occur at home and 23% occur near the home. Hence, a dependable fall detection system has to be developed, and commercially be used all over the globe among the elderly. Depending on fast detection and delivering signals, the cost of the system can be reduced which is interconnected to the reaction and saving time. An enhanced breathe to speech communication and fall detection system for elderly people and also monitoring through a take care analytics is suggested that are based on intelligent sensors that are put by the person using that device."
w,"Government agencies collect large amounts of structured and unstructured data. Although these data can be used to improve services as well as policy processes, it is not always clear how to analyze the data and how to glean insights for policy making, especially when the data includes large volumes of unstructured text data. This article reports opinions found in We the People petition data using topic modeling and visual analytics. It provides an assessment of the usability of the visual analytics results for policy making based on interviews with data professionals and policy makers. We found that visual analytics have potentially positive impacts on policy making practices. Experts also articulated potential barriers regarding the adoption of visual analytics tools, and made suggestions. Potential barriers included insufficient resources in government agencies and difficulty integrating analytics with current work practices. The main suggestions involved providing training and interpretation guidelines along with the visual analytics tools. Major contributions of this study include: (1) suggesting viable visualization tools for analyzing textual data for policy making, and (2) suggesting how to lower barriers to adoption by increasing usability."
w,"Big data is often seen in terms of powerful institutions managing the actions of populations through data. This ethnography of the Quantified Self movement, where participants collect extensive data about their own bodies, identifies practices that go beyond simply internalizing predetermined frameworks. The QS movement attracts the most hungrily panoptical of the data aggregation businesses in addition to people who have developed their own notions of analytics that are separate from, and in relation to, dominant practices of firms and institutionalized scientific production. Their practices constitute an important modality of resistance to dominant modes of living with data, an approach that we call soft resistance. Soft resistance happens when participants assume multiple roles as project designers, data collectors, and critical sense-makers who rapidly shift priorities. This constant shifting keeps data sets fragmented and thus creates material resistance to traditional modes of data aggregation. It also breaks the categories that make traditional aggregations appear authoritative. This enables participants to partially yet significantly escape the frames created by the biopolitics of the health technology industry."
w,"Social media data with geotags can be used to track people's movements in their daily lives. By providing both rich text and movement information, visual analysis on social media data can be both interesting and challenging. In contrast to traditional movement data, the sparseness and irregularity of social media data increase the difficulty of extracting movement patterns. To facilitate the understanding of people's movements, we present an interactive visual analytics system to support the exploration of sparsely sampled trajectory data from social media. We propose a heuristic model to reduce the uncertainty caused by the nature of social media data. In the proposed system, users can filter and select reliable data from each derived movement category, based on the guidance of uncertainty model and interactive selection tools. By iteratively analyzing filtered movements, users can explore the semantics of movements, including the transportation methods, frequent visiting sequences and keyword descriptions. We provide two cases to demonstrate how our system can help users to explore the movement patterns."
w,"The European Union's (EU) Structured Dialogue, a consultation process between young people and policy-makers on the EU's youth policies, has achieved remarkable popularisation and is perceived as a valuable mechanism in finding remedies for the risks facing young people across the EU. Applying the Foucauldian analytics of government approach, this article critically analyses the formation and features of the Structured Dialogue and its practical implementation during the final phase of the third work cycle under the Greek Presidency of the EU (January 2014 to June 2014). It shows that the proliferation of dialogue is a practical feature of government at the EU level undertaken by a multiplicity of stakeholders. In this constellation, risks associated with youth are mobilised as representational notions that render reality in such a form to make it amenable to specific types of operations and interventions. The Structured Dialogue works as a practical form of governing reconstituting power relations so that government is reaffirmed as a valid and legitimate process through which actors collectively search for the best possible outcome and in the interest of all, while youth are pursued and encouraged to make them active citizens capable, as both individuals and communities, of managing their own risk."
w,"Purpose This research study aims to evaluate the capacity and sustainability of an accessible society as a smart society and services with the help of MOOCs and assistive technologies within the learning analytics framework. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative research was employed in this research that interview forms were conducted to get data from 60 participants. Thematic analysis was used to analyze data. Findings Research results revealed that MOOCs and assertive technologies are crucial for smart society and opens a map for open pedagogy. Accessible media, services and applications in smart societies are key elements for disabled people lives. Research limitations/implications Research is limited to numbers of research participants in northern part of Cyprus. Practical implications Establishing strategies and policies for the smart and accessible society and services are intensified need for the disabled people within the framework of learning analytics. Social implications Assistive technologies become medium of facilitating accessible and smart society and services for everyone. Originality/value Education plays a great role to enrich services of societies in order to create inclusive efforts to the life of disabled people. United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organizations (UNESCO) underline the main theme of making inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all. In this respect, accessibility, inclusiveness, equity, equality, quality for lifelong learning are main components to foster accessible and smart society for everyone. Integrating the importance of learning analytics creates a value for understanding of being smart society."
w,"In a recent short report, the necessity of sophisticated practices in gathering records that would facilitate data sharing yields data-driven analysis in time of COVID-19. Consequently, there is a need to present the truth in data analytics in the era of COVID-19.

w,"Many of the industries such as manufacturing, F&B, transportation have recently shown a growing interest in Industry Internet of things (IIoT) to gain competitive advantage. The IIoT is technology stack of combining internet of things, machines, computers and people enabling intelligent business transformational through advanced big data analytics. With the growing complexity of IIoT in a large-scale interconnectivity deployment, access control and authorization of IIoT objects such as smart devices, human or computers becomes the pressing requirements. In this paper, we propose SecIIoT a practical authorization framework on annotated metadata for securing lloT objects. It supports multi-dimension and large data processing with flexible and efficient authorization model to meet new security needs of lloT. In order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework, a prototype is implemented with test results. The experimental results showed that the authorization model works efficiently in a large-scale deployment to meet new IIoT security requirements."
w,"Introduction Recent evidence suggests that influenza vaccination may offer protection against COVID-19 severity. Our aim was to quantify the association between influenza vaccination status and risk of hospitalisation or all-cause mortality in people diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods A retrospective cohort study using routinely collected health records from patients registered to a General Practitioner (GP) practice in South West England within the Electronic Care and Health Information Analytics database. The cohort included 6921 people with COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic (1 January-31 July 2020). Data on influenza vaccination, hospitalisation and all-cause mortality were ascertained through linked clinical and demographic records. We applied propensity score methods (stabilised inverse probability of treatment weight) to quantify the association between influenza vaccination status and COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalisation or all-cause mortality). Results 2613 (38%) participants received an influenza vaccination between 1 January 2019 and COVID-19 diagnosis. Receipt of influenza vaccination was associated with a significantly lower odds of hospitalisation or all-cause mortality (adjusted OR: 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97, p=0.02), and 24% reduced odds of all-cause mortality (adjusted OR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.90). Discussion Influenza vaccination was associated with a 15%-24% lower odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes. The current UK influenza vaccination programme needs urgent expansion as an integral component of the ongoing response plans to the COVID-19 pandemic."
w,"Mainstream feminist studies of conflict explore either its gendering nature/effect, or the heteronormative imagining and enactments of the nation state that it propels. This article argues that systematically employing a single standard approach, without case-specific justification, demarcates overarching theoretical and empirical boundaries, and subsequently slows down the production of feminist knowledge regarding gendered subjectivities during wartime. This article contributes to feminist methodologies by postulating the researcher's analytical engagement with the affective questions produced during research as a technique for interrogating positionalities and permitting shifts in her consciousness to capture the particularities of evidences. After highlighting the workings of this method, the article demonstrates its analytics further through a case study of the Iranian people's gendered subjectivities and narratives of nationhood from 1980 to 1988. The concluding discussion develops an alternative historical framing of Iranians' construction of the self and the nation during this especially violent period in modern Iran."
w,"Performance measurement is the process of making an evidence-based improvement. It reveals the performance gains or gaps, depending on the entity to be measured, being an organization, people, equipment, processes, or systems. After development, big data analytics (BDA) systems massively fail in organizational settings. The reasons, however, are not fully understood. This paper investigates how organizations can quantify the performance of their BDA systems. To answer this question, we investigated performance measures and performance-contributing factors in the existing literature and surveyed users' perceptions of our findings. The results show that metrics of efficiency and effectiveness can be used to measure the performance of the BDA system. The results also demonstrate that technology, competency, and working conditions are the key factors that contribute to the performance of the BDA system.& COPY; 2022 The Authors.

w,"The emerging field of Immersive Analytics investigates how novel display and interaction technologies can enable people to visualise and analyse data and complex information. In this paper, we present ContextuWall, a system for interactive local and remote collaboration using touch and mobile devices as well as displays of various sizes. The system enables groups of users located on different sites to share content to a jointly used virtual desktop which is accessible over a secured network. This virtual desktop can be shown on different large displays simultaneously, taking advantage of their high resolution. To enable users to intuitively share, arrange as well as annotate image content, a purpose-built client software has been developed and can easily be adapted with plug-ins for existing data analytics software. We show exemplary use cases and describe the system architecture and its implementation."
w,"Piecing together social signals from people in different online social networks is key for downstream analytics. However, users may have different usernames in different social networks, making the linkage task difficult. To enable this, we explore a probabilistic approach that uses a domain-specific prior knowledge to address this problem of online social network user profile linkage. At scale, linkage approaches that are based on a naive pairwise comparisons that have quadratic complexity become prohibitively expensive. Our proposed threshold-based canopying framework - named OPL - reduces this pairwise comparisons, and guarantees a upper bound theoretic linear complexity with respect to the dataset size. We evaluate our approaches on real-world, large-scale datasets obtained from Twitter and Linkedin. Our probabilistic classifier integrating prior knowledge into Naive Bayes performs at over 85% F-1-measure for pairwise linkage, comparable to state-of-the-art approaches."
w,"The rapid increase in gene-disease discoveries offers real promise of clinical applications for people and families affected by genetic conditions but for which health professionals are not prepared because of lack of training. The availability of clinically relevant education resources is critical to enabling nurses to develop the appropriate genetics-genomics knowledge and skills to provide optimum care for individuals and families. The Internet is a core resource to support teaching and learning in nurse education. Evaluating such resources is important to maximise the education experience, particularly for subjects traditionally perceived by nurses as being difficult. Telling Stories, Understanding Real Life Genetics is a web-based educational resource. It uses real accounts from individuals and professionals to promote understanding of the impact of genetics-genomics on the lives of people and their families. Google Analytics (TM) Web analytics service provides time series data for analysing web usage to optimise website effectiveness. We present data of visitor activity and behaviour from 123 countries over three years from 2009-2011 and consider how the application of the web analytics informs approaches to enhancing visibility of the website, provides an indicator of engagement with genetics-genomics both nationally and globally, and informs future expansion of the site as a global resource for health professional education. Telling Stories is an accessible, broad-reaching resource that is of global relevance for health professionals, attracting over 33,500 visitors between 2009-2011, with steadily increasing numbers of returning visitors. The United Kingdom, United States, Canada and the Netherlands are the largest site users. Returning visitors spend significantly more time on site and view more pages than new visitors. Most referring sites are education establishments. More needs to be done now to enhance the site's accessibility for people of other languages and cultures."
w,"Various flavours of a new research field on (socio-) physical or personal analytics have emerged, with the goal of deriving semantically-rich insights from people's low-level physical sensing combined with their (online) social interactions. In this paper, we argue for more comprehensive data sources, including environmental and application-specific data, to better capture the interactions between users and their context, in addition to those among users. We provide some example use cases and present our ongoing work towards a synergistic analytics platform: a testbed based on mobile crowdsensing and IoT, a data model for representing the different sources of data and their connections, and a prediction engine for analyzing the data and producing insights."
w,"This paper introduces the concept of Social Media Geographic Information (SMGI) as an emergent pluralist source of information which - it is argued-may find valuable application in spatial planning and Geodesign. On the base of empirical research, the author proposes a tentative framework for SMGI Analytics in spatial planning. Among other methods, Spatial-Temporal Textual Analysis (STTx) is proposed as a tool to investigate people perceptions and interest in space and time. Possible implications and benefits of SMGI analytics for the planning practice emerge from the overall discussion."
w,"Delay discounting, a behavioral measure of impulsivity, is often used to quantify the human tendency to choose a smaller, sooner reward (e.g., $1 today) over a larger, later reward ($2 tomorrow). Delay discounting and its relation to human decision making is a hot topic in economics and behavior science since pitting the demands of long-term goals against short-term desires is among the most difficult tasks in human decision making. Previously, small-scale studies based on questionnaires were used to analyze an individual's delay discounting rate (DDR) and its relation to his/her real-world behavior such as substance abuse, pathological gambling and poor academic performance. In this research, we employ large-scale social media analytics to study DDR and its relation to people's social media behavior (e.g., their Likes on Facebook). We also build computational models to automatically infer DDR from Social Media Likes. Since the predicting feature space is very large and the size of the delay discounting ground truth dataset is relatively small, we focus on studying the impact of different unsupervised feature learning methods on predicting performance. Our results demonstrate the significant role unsupervised feature learning plays in this task."
w,"This article presents a framework for understanding and explaining digital creativity within the growing area of interactive visual analytics. Through the study of extant literature, existing software products, and our own development experience, various aspects of digital creativity are explored in the context of interactive visual analytics and its application to decision-making and problem-solving. The proposed framework explores and fuses a number of models of individual, social, and domain creativity. It explains the challenges of the analyst navigating through rapidly growing and ubiquitous digital data with an objective to explore it, discover its meanings and associations, as well as solve problems and arrive at effective business decisions. As a creative process, interactive visual analytics differs from other forms of digital creativity, as it utilizes analytic models, relies on the analyst's mental imagery and involves an iterative process of generation and evaluation of ideas in digital media, as well as planning, execution, and refinement of the associated actions. This process is also characterized as collaborative and social by nature as it comprises of analysts from data, problem, and visual domains, who share ideas and actions during analytic activities. We conclude by suggesting that interactive data visualization may provide opportunities for lay people to creatively engage with data analytics to explore the vast data resources that are freely available and in so doing, gain and communicate insights which may have the potential to impact their private lives and the world at large.

w,"Safety-oriented visualization is one of significant approaches to gain insights from time-spatial data while neural net currently serves as a decent way to perform machine learning in data mining industry. This paper proposes a visual analytics pipeline for trajectory data enabling better understanding movements pattern of people using Neural Network as back-end and other visualization techniques as front-end for gaining information of preferences of attractions, similarities of groups, popularities of attractions and pattern of movement flow. Such understandings help to address the management issue by extracting the outstanding features to detect abnormal pattern such as detection of crime and predicting overall movements, and so on. Successfully dealing with those issues would have significant improvements of entire management of public facility such as parks and transportation."
w,"The human brain is built to process complex visual impressions within milliseconds. In comparison with sequentially coded spoken language and written texts, we are capable of consuming graphical information at a high bandwidth in a parallel fashion, producing a picture worth more than a thousand words. Effective information visualization can be a powerful tool to capture people's attention and quickly communicate large amounts of data and complex information. This is particularly important in the context of communication data, which often describes entities (people, organizations) and their connections through communication. Visual analytics approaches can optimize the user-computer interaction to gain insights into communication networks and learn about their structures. Network visualization is a perfect instrument to better communicate the results of analysis. The precondition for effective information visualization and successful visual reasoning is the capability to draw good pictures. Even though communication networks are often large, including thousands or even millions of people, underlying visualization principles are identical to those used for visualizing smaller networks. In this article, you will learn about these principles, giving you the ability to assess the quality of network visualizations and to draw better network pictures by yourself."
w,"Telemedicine, Electronic Health Records (EHR) and social media seem to have a promising direction for an intensive approach to deal with diabetes. With the rapid advances in ICT, various diabetes information systems have evolved. The availability of new technologies for monitoring and treating diabetes is helping to achieve recommended metabolic control. The usage of social media in healthcare is also gaining much popularity as people wish to share their ideas and ask for advice with others having the same disease. The paper therefore presents a model for classifying people who could potentially be at risk of Diabetes Mellitus using social media analytics. A prototype has been implemented based on the model."
w,"Social media has grown in popularity for past few decades and millions of people have expressed information about themselves and their feelings on sites like Twitter. Geography is a predictor of moods that is expressed on Twitter. Using geotagged tweets can help correlate happiness with region on lifestyle measures such as gun violence and natural disasters. In this study, we provide Bag Data Analytics methods to perform a sentiment analysis based on geographical location to analyze where are people happy about particular trending topics on Twitter."
w,"Today's world is moving with very great kind of technologies and there are solutions and services being developed for each and every problem in the world. One of the sector which require more of our attention is the agriculture sector. Food is the basic and important source to our body. Nowadays, with increase in population-rate and decrease in food production. This is being reduced due to industrial purposes or due any other issues. The land that is allotted for agriculture purpose is currently very less when compared to the land that is needed for population requirements. Vertical farming is one of the solution that can be implemented to overcome this problem, where the plants are grown in vertical stacks and it can be done in any building or container. We are implementing CEA technology where the environmental factors such as temperature and humidity of the agricultural can be controlled and monitored by us. We're making use of IOT in order to connect our technology to our farming setup. The system was designed to monitoring and automation of factors such as temperature, humidity and pH. Several factors such as crop yield, health of the plant, accuracy etc... are taken into consideration. These data will be uploaded into the cloud and analyzed by Big Data Analytics using various algorithms so that other people can make use of the data."
w,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution - also known as Industry 4.0 (i4.0) - comprises the digitalisation of the industrial sector. This paper uses the theoretical lens of supply chain innovation (SCI) to investigate the implications of i4.0 on supply chain management. For these purposes, the method of structured content analysis is applied to more than 200 use cases of i4.0-enabled SCI introduced by both established and startup companies. i4.0-enabled SCI manifests along three dimensions: process, technology, and business architecture. The key findings of this study can be summarised as follows: first, i4.0-enabled SCI extends the initial focus on productivity improvements in SC processes towards scalability and flexibility. Second, extant i4.0 solutions rely mostly on analytics and smart things while omitting smart people technology and the human-centric approach associated with the i4.0 paradigm. Third, established companies adopt i4.0 merely to sustain their existing business architectures while startup companies radically change their operating models, relying heavily on data analytics and the platform economy. Consequently, established companies pursue a problem-driven, engineering-based approach to SCI while startup companies follow an 'asset-light', business-driven approach. Lastly, there are two distinct approaches to digitalising operational SC processes: platform-based crowdsourcing of standard processes and on-demand provision of customised services."
w,"Immersive Analytics (IA) and Augmented Reality (AR) head-mounted displays provide a different paradigm for people to analyze multidimensional data and externalize their thoughts by utilizing the stereoscopic nature of headsets. However, using annotation in IA-AR is challenging and not well-understood. In addition, IA collaborative environments add another complexity level for users operating on complex visualized datasets. Current AR systems focus mainly on synchronized collaboration, while asynchronous collaboration has remained unexplored. This project investigates annotation in IA for asynchronous collaborative environments. We present our research studies on virtual annotation types and introduce a new filtering annotation technique for IA."

The paper defines the scenario and requirements for such a system and proposes an architecture and implementation solutions based on new MS2G (Modeling, interoperable Simulation and Serious Games) paradigm"
w,"Corporations gather massive amounts of personal data to predict how individuals will behave so that they can profitably price goods and allocate resources. This article investigates the moral foundations of such increasingly prevalent market practices. I leverage the case of credit scores in car insurance pricing-an early and controversial use of algorithmic prediction in the U.S. consumer economy-to unpack the premise that predictive data are fair to use and to understand the conditions under which people are likely to challenge that moral logic. Policymaker resistance to credit-based insurance scores reveals that contention arises when predictions depend on mathematical distinctions that do not align with broader understandings of good and bad behavior, and when theories about why predictions work point to the market holding people accountable for actions that are not really their fault. Via a de-commensuration process, policymakers realign the market with their own notions of moral deservingness. This article thus demonstrates the importance of causal understanding and moral categorization for people accepting markets as fair. As data and analytics permeate markets of all sorts, as well as other domains of social life, these findings have implications for how social scientists understand the novel forms of stratification that result."
w,"As far as urban population continuously grows, the need of intelligent transport systems becomes more and more relevant to deal with transport needs for both people and cargo. Automated devices for data capture requires the implementation of analytics techniques in order to provide insights for actual decision-making and policy design. The objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, this paper reviews academic literature about big data analytics for intelligent transportation systems; and secondly builds upon previous works to propose a simple, yet complete, framework for the design of an architecture to deal with big data analytics in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). The outputs of this work will be implemented to analyze transport data for a big city in Colombia. Copyright (C) 2021 The Authors."
w,"Research on the effects of social media has evidenced their influence on public opinion concerning health issues. However, there are scarce analyses that pay attention to this influence when health advice generalizes certain groups' sexual practices. This generalization occurred with monkeypox, men who have sex with men, after two World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations launched in 2022. Therefore, this is the issue that will be deeply explored in the article. Drawing on the methodological strategy of social media analytics (SMA), 2313 tweets have been reviewed focused on people's reactions in front of WHO's statements of July 2022 about monkeypox and men who have sex with men behaviours. Findings illustrate that there is positioning against the generalizations caused due to WHO's statement creating a public discourse against the stigma of homosexual and bisexual men. This positioning is directly linked with people's claims to follow the evidence and valid claims on public health issues. Using social networks for claiming the use of rigorous data and evidence may contribute to a significant change in public opinion and health organizations."
w,"With the emergence of social networks and their potential impact on society, many research groups and originations are collecting huge amount of social media data from various sites to serve different applications. These systems offer insights on different facets of society at different moments of time. Collectively they are known as social observatory systems. This paper describes the architecture and implementation of a live social observatory system named 'NExT-Live'. It aims to analyze the live online social media data streams to mine social senses, phenomena, influences and geographical trends dynamically. It incorporates an efficient and robust set of crawlers to continually crawl online social interactions on various social network sites. The data crawled are stored and processed in a distributed Hadoop architecture. It then performs the analysis on these social media streams jointly to generate analytics at different levels. In particular, it generates high-level analytics about the sense of different target entitles, including People, Locations, Topics and Organizations. NExT-Live offers a live observatory platform that enables people to know the happenings of the place in order to lead better life."
w,"The emerging field of Immersive Analytics investigates how novel display and interaction technologies can enable people to better explore and analyse data and complex information. Collaboration is a crucial aspect of Immersive Analytics. In this paper we present ContextuWall, a system for interactive local and remote collaboration using touch and mobile devices as well as displays of various sizes. The system enables groups of userd located on different sites to share content to a jointly used virtual desktop which is accessible over a secured network. This virtual desktop can be shown on different large displays simultaneously, taking advantage of their high resolution. To enable user to intuitively share, arrage as well as annotate image content, a purpose-built client software has been developed and can easily be adapted with plug-ins for existing data analytics software. We show exemplary use cases and describe the system architecture and its implementation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
w,"Spreadsheets are the best-known form of End User Programming. End-user programmers (EUP) write programs, but not as their primary job function They frequently develop software to perform tabular data visualization and analytics using spreadsheets and spreadsheets' formulas as a general purpose programming language. Recently spreadsheets shifted from personal office tools aimed at improving people productivity to enterprise level tools aimed at supporting distributed analytics and decisions. Distributed analytics often requires data sharing among different processes. The spreadsheet supported distributed analytics poses new challenges in spreadsheet data sharing. As in mainstream programming environments, end user spreadsheet programmers need an efficient way to handle shared data access inside spreadsheets to perform collaborative analysis of data. We propose a solution that focuses on spreadsheet element data sharing and collaboration instead of file sharing and collaboration. We present a distributed end to end encrypted tabular data sharing platform called Spreadsheet Space that supports end user programmers for fine grained spreadsheet element data sharing for collaborative analytics."
w,"This paper presents an important concept of Internet of People, a social network analysis approach to perform Big Data Analytics. The paper describes the development, management implications and analysis. To illustrate six points in the management issues, an in-house development of a SocialNetwork API with six functions has been demonstrated. The proposed method is focused on processing the contacts who click like or comment on the author's posts, as well as the queries and visualization. Results can be extracted and presented in data visualization. Six functions in the SocialNetwork API have evaluation tests, including a large scale of 50,000 simulations completed within 60,000 s. Results support our case of Big Data processing for social network analysis can be equivalent to CRM, ERP and MIS. Additionally, there are no costs involved. Related topics have been discussed in details. Our research contributions have been consolidated since our work have met research challenges for social network analysis and six management implications."
w,"Poverty as an object of study in India continues to be the domain of economists, statisticians and demographers. The National Sample Survey Organisation (NSS) serves as the main instrument of data collection to measure poverty relative to economic indicators. In this paper we draw on strengths-based research undertaken in an Indian village to foreground alternative ways of conceptualising and practising data collection when measuring poverty. Explored through an analytics of biopolitics, asset-mapping exercises with young people and women revealed new subjectivities that emerged via illustrative meaning-making and dialogue. This approach to poverty measurement facilitated methods and produced outcomes that were less calculated and predefined than the NSS, and encouraged participation, even questioning of the status quo, in the 'doing' of the methodology itself. A strengths orientation to poverty opens up radical possibilities, particularly in India where the state-sanctioned self--governing body, the Gram Sabhas, has a mandate to provide for the most marginalised groups. And while this governing body is not free from power imbalances, the potential it offers, when combined with strengths-based approaches (SBA) that value people for the expertise they already have, demands renewed attention in practitioner and policy debates in the country."

Innovative multimodal face analytics, adaptive spoken dialogue systems and natural language interfaces are part of what the project will research and innovate, in order to help dependent aging persons and their carers. The project will use remote non-intrusive technologies to extract physiological markers of emotional states in real-time for online adaptive responses of the coach, and advance holistic modelling of behavioural, computational, physical and social aspects of a personalised expressive virtual coach. It will develop causal models of coach-user interactional exchanges that engage elders in emotionally believable interactions keeping off loneliness, sustaining health status, enhancing quality of life and simplifying access to future telecare services"
w,"Young people are routinely depicted as uniquely violent. Much work has been done, particularly within the sociology of youth, to dispel this misconception. However, these portrayals persist, as does the narrative of youth as a period of transition. This article argues that the transition in youth is a process of governing violence into sanctioned forms. To achieve adult status young people must conform to sanctioned forms of violence. Furthermore, the article argues that the physical, structural and symbolic violence done to young people, shapes the violence done by them. Youth is an intensely governed period. The young people in focus in this article are subject to additional governing by the state. They are hyper-governed. This article draws on labelling theory and the analytics of governmentality to analyse hyper-governed young people's experiences of ubiquitous violence. Hyper-governed young people describe experiences of neoliberal violence' that produce docility and progressively increasing commitments to the norms of violence. The article concludes, therefore, that youth is an artefact of violence that governs, but also the product of governing young people's violence. Youth as an artefact of governing violence describes violence done to young people shaping violence done by young people."
w,"Widespread human action and behavior change is needed to achieve many conservation goals. Doing so at the requisite scale and pace will require the efficient delivery of outreach campaigns. Conservation gains will be greatest when efforts are directed toward places of high conservation value (or need) and tailored to critical actors. Recent strategic conservation planning has relied primarily on spatial assessments of biophysical attributes, largely ignoring the human dimensions. Elsewhere, marketers, political campaigns, and others use microtargeting-predictive analytics of big data-to identify people most likely to respond positively to particular messages or interventions. Conservationists have not yet widely capitalized on these techniques. To investigate the effectiveness of microtargeting to improve conservation, we developed a propensity model to predict restoration behavior among 203,645 private landowners in a 5,200,000 ha study area in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (U.S.A.). To isolate the additional value microtargeting may offer beyond geospatial prioritization, we analyzed a new high-resolution land-cover data set and cadastral data to identify private owners of riparian areas needing restoration. Subsequently, we developed and evaluated a restoration propensity model based on a database of landowners who had conducted restoration in the past and those who had not (n = 4978). Model validation in a parallel database (n = 4989) showed owners with the highest scorers for propensity to conduct restoration (i.e., top decile) were over twice as likely as average landowners to have conducted restoration (135%). These results demonstrate that microtargeting techniques can dramatically increase the efficiency and efficacy of conservation programs, above and beyond the advances offered by biophysical prioritizations alone, as well as facilitate more robust research of many social-ecological systems."
w,"Crowd behaviour analytics focuses on behavioural characteristics of groups of people instead of individuals' activities. This work considers human queuing behaviour which is a specific crowd behavior of groups. We design a plug-and-play system solution to the queue detection problem based on Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) received signal strength indicators (RSSIs) captured by multiple signal sniffers. The goal of this work is to determine if a device is in the queue based on only RSSIs. The key idea is to extract features not only from individual device's data but also mobility similarity between data from multiple devices and mobility correlation observed by multiple sniffers. Thus, we propose single-device feature extraction, cross-device feature extraction, and cross-sniffer feature extraction for model training and classification. We systematically conduct experiments with simulated queue movements to study the detection accuracy. Finally, we compare our signal-based approach against camera-based face detection approach in a real-world social event with a real human queue. The experimental results indicate that our approach can reach minimum accuracy of 77% and it significantly outperforms the camera-based face detection because people block each other's visibility whereas wireless signals can be detected without blocking."
w,"Introduction. - The platform My Cancer Network (MCN) is a digital tool allowing better identification of support available after treatments of cancer and to help return to work. Method. - The results regarding the use of this platform are compared to those people who requested support from the department of return to work after cancer at Rouen University Hospital. We use data from Google Analytics 4 and data published concerning 150 people who requested support of this department. Gender and age of people who benefited from the department and the platform were compared using a Chi(2) test. Results. - The platform has been consulted by 9357 users. We compared their profile with 150 people who benefited from support from the department. People who consulted the platform were significantly more often male and under 45 years old than the people who benefited from support through the CHU department ( P < 0.001 in both cases). In all, 9909 patient pages were viewed. Of the 5 sections, the most read are Aids to return to work, Preparing well for return to work and After cancer. Discussion. - This digital solution offers an opportunity for wider distribution at the national level and demonstrates its interest in complementarity with already existing packages. Care Centers and Cancer Centers could use this tool to better inform patients. Conclusion. - Almost exhaustive information, gathered on a single platform, which can be updated regularly, offers the possibility of raising awareness of all existing and available support."
w,"With the acceleration of urbanization and modern civilization, more and more complex regions are formed in urban area. Although understanding these regions could provide huge insights to facilitate valuable applications for urban planning and business intelligence, few methods have been developed to effectively capture the rapid transformation of urban regions. In recent years, the widely applied location-acquisition technologies offer a more effective way to capture the dynamics of a city through analyzing people's movement activities based on mobility data. However, several challenges exist, including data sparsity and difficulties in result understanding and validation. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose MobiSeg, an interactive visual analytics system, which supports the exploration of people's movement activities to segment the urban area into regions sharing similar activity patterns. A joint analysis is conducted on three types of heterogeneous mobility data (i.e., taxi trajectories, metro passenger RFID card data, and telco data), which can complement each other and provide a full picture of people's activities in a region. In addition, advanced analytical algorithms (e.g., non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based method to capture latent activity patterns, as well as metric learning to calibrate and supervise the underlying analysis) and novel visualization designs are integrated into our system to provide a comprehensive solution to region segmentation in urban areas. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system via case studies with real-world datasets and qualitative interviews with domain experts."
w,"Geo-tagged social media data can be viewed as sampling of people's trajectories in daily life. It consists of people's movements and embeds the semantics of movements. However, it is challenging to reveal patterns from the sparse and irregular sampling data. We proposed an interactive multi-filter visualization approach to analyze the spatial-temporal movement pattern in people's daily life. People's trajectories are visualized on the map with multiple functional layers. With our visual analytics tools, users are able to drill down to details, with the awareness of the origin-destination flow patterns of spatial, temporal, and semantic meaning."
w,"Understanding what insights people draw from data visualizations is critical for human-in-the loop analytics systems to facilitate mixed-initiative analysis. In this paper we present results from a large user study on insights extracted from commonly used charts. We report several patterns of insights we observed and analyze their semantic structure to identify key considerations towards a unified formal representation of insight, human or computer generated. We also present a model of insight generation process, where humans and computers work cooperatively, building on each other's knowledge, where a common representation acts as the currency of interaction. While not going as far as proposing a formalism, we point to a few potential directions for representing insight. We believe our findings could also inform the design of novel human-in-the-loop analytics systems."
w,"Deep neural networks are increasingly deployed for scene analytics, including to evaluate the attention and reaction of people exposed to out-of-home advertisements. However, the features extracted by a deep neural network that was trained to predict a specific, consensual attribute (e.g. emotion) may also encode and thus reveal information about private, protected attributes (e.g. age or gender). In this work, we focus on such leakage of private information at inference time. We consider an adversary with access to the features extracted by the layers of a deployed neural network and use these features to predict private attributes. To prevent the success of such an attack, we modify the training of the network using a confusion loss that encourages the extraction of features that make it difficult for the adversary to accurately predict private attributes. We validate this training approach on image-based tasks using a publicly available dataset. Results show that, compared to the original network, the proposed PrivateNet can reduce the leakage of private information of a state-of-the-art emotion recognition classifier by 2.88% for gender and by 13.06% for age group, with a minimal effect on task accuracy."
w,"Healthcare is transforming with data-intensive omics technologies and Big Data. The revolution'' has already happened in technology, but the bottlenecks have shifted to the social domain: Who can be empowered by Big Data? Who are the users and customers? In this review and innovation field analysis, we introduce the idea of a super-customer'' versus customer'' and relate both to 21st century healthcare. A super-customer'' in healthcare is the patient, sample size of n = 1, while customers'' are the providers of healthcare (e.g., doctors and nurses). The super-customers have been patients, enabled by unprecedented social practices, such as the ability to track one's physical activities, personal genomics, patient advocacy for greater autonomy, and self-governance, to name but a few. In contrast, the originally intended customers-providers, doctors, and nurses-have relatively lagged behind. With patients as super-customers, there are valuable lessons to be learned from industry examples, such as Amazon and Uber. To offer superior quality service, healthcare organizations have to refocus on the needs, pains, and aspirations of their super-customers by enabling the customers. We propose a strategic solution to this end: the PPT-DAM (People-Process-Technology empowered by Data, Analytics, and Metrics) approach. When applied together with the classic Experiment-Execute-Evaluate iterative methodology, we suggest PPT-DAM is an extremely powerful approach to deliver quality health services to super-customers and customers. As an example, we describe the PPT-DAM implementation by the Benchmarking Improvement Program at the Seattle Children's Hospital. Finally, we forecast that cognitive systems in general and IBM Watson in particular, if properly implemented, can bring transformative and sustainable capabilities in healthcare far beyond the current ones."
w,"Exploring human mobility dynamics is a challenging semantic data analysis task as conventional information retrieval techniques fail to detect why people travel. We propose a mobility analytics framework to discover such trip-purposes from individual's GPS traces using a mobility knowledge graph (MKG) and a deep-learning architecture that automatically annotates the GPS log. Further, a novel transfer learning technique is proposed to analyze the movement dynamics in another geographically dispersed region with the help of the knowledge gained from a region of similar type (say, academic campus). The time-stamped sequence of location data (e.g., latitude, longitude) of any moving agent such as people or vehicle, is referred to as the trajectory. The scarcity of labelled GPS logs is the major limitation in any supervised learning technique to annotate trip-purposes. As illustrated in Fig. 1, let us consider an example scenario with two region-of-interests (ROIs), namely source ROI (SG) and target ROI (TG). As depicted, three data-sources, namely, road-network (D1), individuals' labelled GPS traces (D2), and crowd-flow or aggregated GPS footprints (D3) in different time-scales of the ROIs are considered. Here, aggregated GPS footprints means the footprint density at POIs in different time-intervals of a region. It subsequently helps to determine the crowd-flow at a place, and acts as the characteristics of the POI. The data-source (D2) comprises of either the activity performed at a place (say, attending lecture), or the intent of a trip/ movement (say, commuting for medical-help). Such annotations/ labels are difficult to obtain, and through domain adaptation, our framework attempts to learn from the source region (SG), and maps the knowledge to another dispersed, but potentially connected target region (TG) to annotate the users' unlabelled trajectories and identify POIs of TG."

w,"Background. Various interventions are reportedly effective in promoting organ donor registration. However, the identity of those who best serve as presenters to appeal to the general public is not known.Methods. A campaign for organ donor registration was conducted through a local newspaper advertisement in Japan. The advertisement appeared in 439,733 copies of the newspaper on January 9, 2021. In addition to the main message, 6 different presenters with photos of their faces and quick response codes were listed in the advertisement, namely a urologist, transplant physician, nephrologist, dialysis physician, ophthalmologist, and kidney transplant recipient who was a nephrologist himself (ie, a recipient and nephrologist). Newspaper readers watched each video about deceased organ donation via the quick response codes, and the number of video views acquired 30 days after the appearance was the main outcome, which was assessed using YouTube analytics. The proportions (95% CI) of people who watched each video among 439,733 newspaper readers were compared among the 6 presenters.Results. The analyzed videos were viewed 262 times. The video produced by the recipient and nephrologist had the highest number of views among the 6 presenters (proportion: 0.019% [95% CI, 0.015-0.023]), followed by the one produced by the dialysis physician (0.011% [95% CI, 0.008-0.014]), the nephrologist (0.010% [95% CI, 0.007-0.014]), the urologist (0.008% [95% CI, 0.006-0.012]), the transplant physician (0.006% [95% CI, 0.004-0.009]), and the ophthalmologist (0.005% [95% CI, 0.004-0.008]).Conclusions. The appeal by the recipient and the nephrologist reached the highest proportion of people who watched the video about deceased organ donation in Japan."
w,"What does human rights mean to the Chinese government in the post-Tiananmen era? Has the way by which Beijing conceptualizes human rights changed over time? What policies and practices have Beijing's human rights conception privileged or delegitimized? The article takes on these intriguing questions by analyzing human rights stories in the People's Daily. The research applies the methods of text analytics and discourse analysis to shed light on the Party-state's effort of incorporating and reformulating the idea of human rights. It is found that, since 1989, the Chinese government has developed two major conceptions of human rights. Throughout the 1990s, human rights had been understood mainly as a source of regime threat and insecurity, hence requiring containment and rejection. Beginning in the early 2000s, an alternative argument was constructed that conceptualizes human rights as the governing capacity of the Party-state, hence deserving reception and acclamation. The rights-as-capacity argument has developed side-by-side with the rights-as-threat conception, resulting in an illiberal and dualistic rights regime in Chinese politics."
w,"The contemporary world's emerging issue is how the mental health and falling of a senior citizen with a neurological disorder can be maintained living at their homes as the number of aged people is increasing with the rising of life expectancy. With the advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data analytics, several works had been done on smart home health care systems that deal with in house monitoring for fall detection. Despite so much work, the challenges remain for not considering emotional care in the fall detection system for the old ones. As a remedy to the problems mentioned above, we propose an emotion aware fall monitoring framework using IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) Algorithms, and Big data analytics, which will deal with emotion recognition of the aged people, predictions about health conditions, and real-time fall monitoring. In the case of an emergency, the proposed framework alerts about a situation of urgency to the predefined caregiver. A smart ambulance or mobile clinic will reach the older adult's location at minimum time."
w,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are usually six to ten weeks long. Participation tends to decrease as the courses progress, leading to low completion rates. This led to the question: Could shorter MOOCs contribute to learners' engagement, retention and success? This paper compares two versions of Study Skills MOOC, which shared the same content but were delivered in different length formats. One was deployed as a single six-week course and the other as two three-week blocks. In total, 617 people registered for the two versions. Data sources included learning analytics, surveys and the Spanish version of the General Self-Efficacy Scale. Both versions of the Study Skills MOOC resulted in increased participants' self-efficacy. However, learners enrolled in the version composed of two three-week blocks were also more engaged with course content, other students and the facilitators. Their retention and completion rates were higher than those in the longer version of the course. Reasons linked to goal proximity, motivation, interactions and social modelling are discussed"
w,"Recently, a new horizon in data analytics, prescriptive analytics, is becoming more and more important to make data-driven decisions. As opposed to the progress of democratizing data acquisition and access, making data-driven decisions remains a significant challenge for people without technical expertise. In this regard, existing tools for data analytics which were designed decades ago still present a high bar for domain experts, and removing this bar requires a fundamental rethinking of both interface and backend. At Einblick, an MIT/Brown spin-off based on the Northstar project, we have been building the next generation analytics tool in the last few years. To overcome the shortcomings of existing processing engines, we propose Davos, Einblick's novel backend. Davos combines aspects of progressive computation, approximate query processing and sampling, with a specific focus on supporting user-defined operations. Moreover, Davos optimizes multi-tenant scenarios to promote collaboration. Both empirical evaluation and user study verify that Davos can greatly empower data analytics for new needs."
w,"Objective Little is known about the effectiveness of a psychosocial behaviour management programme on home-dwelling people with dementia. We developed a Behaviour Analytics & Support Enhancement (BASE) programme for care managers and professional caregivers of home care services in Japan. We investigated the effects of BASE on challenging behaviour of home-dwelling people with dementia. MethodsA cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted with home care providers from 3 different districts in Tokyo. Each provider recruited persons with dementia aged 65years or older to receive home care in the BASE programme in August 2016. An online monitoring and assessment system was introduced to the intervention group for repeated measures of challenging behaviour with a total score of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Care professionals in both the intervention and control groups evaluated challenging behaviour of persons with dementia at baseline (September 2016) and follow-up (February 2017). ResultsA majority of persons with dementia had Alzheimer disease (59.3%). One-hundred and forty-one persons with dementia were included in the intervention group and 142 in the control group. Multilevel modelling revealed a significant reduction in challenging behaviour in the intervention group after 6months (mean score, 18.3 to 11.2) compared with that of the control group (11.6 to 10.8; P<.05). ConclusionThe implementation of the BASE programme resulted in a reduction of challenging behaviour of home-dwelling people with dementia. Future research should examine the long-term effects of behaviour management programmes on behaviour, nursing home placement, and hospital admission of home-dwelling people with dementia."
w,"Displaying multivariate tempo-spatial data such as from competitive strategy games can support people in the challenging task of analyzing them. Within the Immersive Analytics discipline, technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality are utilized for rendering such complex data and extending the tool set of analysts. In this paper, we introduce 3D Hexglyph Maps - a visualization technique drawing from both the Space-Time Cube and the Hexbin Map techniques for use in VR. We illustrate how we applied our glyph-based technique for analyzing trajectorial match data of the prominent Electronic Sports game League of Legends and discuss identified potential and limitations. The results of our user study show that our technique performed well concerning the completion rates, that our participants needed a short period before efficiently understanding the visualization by means of the completion times, and that an increase of the players whose data are visualized leads to a slight deceleration of the analysis process."
w,"Connected Wellness/Healthcare is all about retrieving people's physiological parameters through sensors and performing analysis. Individually, such analytics can help a patient to maintain a wellness regime, or to decide when to see a doctor, and can assist doctors in diagnosis. Collectively, such analytics, if performed over a long time over large set of patients, has the potential to discover new disease diagnostic and treatment protocols. In this chapter, we first discuss how advances in sensing and analytics can take us from a reactive illness-driven healthcare system to a proactive wellness-driven system. We introduce an IoT driven architecture and discuss how non-invasive, affordable, unobtrusive sensing using mobile phones, wearables and nearables is making physiological and pathological data collection from human body possible in thus far unimaginable ways. We also introduce breakthrough technologies in form of exosomes and 3D organ printing that has the potential to disrupt the future healthcare landscape."

This review paper envisions a systems architecture to empower a connected vehicle-to-X environment by integrating smart sensing and crowdsourcing technologies, large-scale cloud data analytics and computation, and predictive decision making and optimization into a coherent socio-technical configuration of people, operations and information through multimodal, real-time traffic monitoring, planning and control. Key technical challenges and research issues are discussed with respect to an illustrative case of roadway work zones."
w,"This paper examines the enactment of feedback in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), focusing on analytics dashboards. Building on scholarship that recognizes data practices as entangled and 'messy', the paper problematizes the model of the feedback loop that assumes that analytics dashboards 'feed back' data to instructors and/or learners through a singular flow of data processing. By setting out an empirical study that focuses on four MOOCs, in two universities and on two platforms, the paper maps where, when, and how design teams, instructors, and learners are involved in the enactment of feedback through and beyond analytics dashboards. The findings draw on visualizations that highlight complex relations among people and technologies, which include multiple 'loops'. The paper concludes with questioning the need to capture feedback in a singular loop and suggests prioritizing continued attention to the roles and responsibilities of people - educational designers, instructors, and learners - in MOOCs."
w,"The rise of social media has turned the Web into an online community where people connect, communicate, and collaborate with each other. Structured analytics in social media is the process of discovering the structure of the relationships emerging from this social media use. It focuses on identifying the users involved, the activities they undertake, the actions they perform, and the items (e.g., movies, restaurants, blogs, etc.) they create and interact with. There are two key challenges facing these tasks: how to organize and model social media content, which is often unstructured in its raw form, in order to employ structured analytics on it; and how to employ analytics algorithms to capture both explicit link-based relationships and implicit behavior-based relationships. In this tutorial, we systemize and summarize the research so far in analyzing social interactions between users and items in the Web from data mining and database perspectives. We start with a general overview of the topic, including discourse to various exciting and practical applications. Then, we discuss the state-of-art for modeling the data, formalizing the mining task, developing the algorithmic solutions, and evaluating on real datasets. We also emphasize open problems and challenges for future research in the area of structured analytics and social media."
w,"As an emerging trend in data science, applications based on big data analytics are reshaping health informatics and medical scenarios.Currently, peoples are more cognizant and seek solutions to their healthcareproblems online. In the chorus, selecting a healthcare professional or organization is a tedious and time-consuming process. Patients may vainly spend time and meet severaldoctors until one is found that suits theirexact needs. Frequently, they do not have sufficient information on whereupon to base a decision. This has led to a dire requirementfor an efficient anddependablepatient-specific online tool to find out an appropriatedoctor in a limited time.In this paper, we propose a hybrid Physician Recommender System(PRS) by integrating various recommender approaches such asdemographic, collaborative, and content-based filtering for findingsuitabledoctors in line with the preferred choices of patients and their ratings. The proposed system resolves the problem of customization by studyingthe patient's criteriaforchoosing a physician. It employs an adaptive algorithm to find the overall rank of the particular doctor. Furthermore, this ranking method is applied to convert patients' preferred choices into a numerical base rating, which will ultimately be employed inour physician recommender system. The proposed system has been appraisedcarefully, and the result reveals that recommendations are rational and can satisfythe patient's need for consistentphysician selection successfully."
w,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to 1) describe the implementation of the Testing is Healthy campaign in four locations in British Columbia (BC) and 2) report process evaluation indicators for the campaign. PARTICIPANTS: Young adults ages 20-29 years, the age group with the highest reported rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea in BC. SETTINGS: Movie theatres located in Langley, Burnaby, Coquitlam and Surrey, which are communities served by the Fraser Health Authority (FHA) in BC. INTERVENTION: The FHA launched the campaign in 2014 and 2015 to bring down the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV in the region. The campaign used the Cineplex TimePlay platform to engage moviegoers in answering STI/HIV-related questions, and to connect them to a clinic finder on the BC Centre for Disease Control Sex Smart Resource (SSR) website. TimePlay includes elements of gaming, is technology-based, and has been a successful advertisement platform for consumer products and services. However, this is the first time it has been used for sexual health promotion. The campaign was evaluated for 1) reach, based on theatre attendance and TimePlay participation, and 2) the effectiveness of connecting people to sexual health information using SSR web analytics. OUTCOMES: In total, the campaign received 548 410 views and 77 149 plays. SSR web analytics showed a significant increase in unique page views of the Clinic Finder page between the first and the second campaign."
w,"Everyday life is increasingly mediated by technology. Technology is rapidly growing capacity and complexity, especially evident in developments in artificial intelligence and big data analytics. As human-computer interaction (HCI) endeavors to examine and theorize how people act and interact with the ever-evolving technology, an important, emerging concern is how the self-the totality of internal qualities such as consciousness and agency-plays out in relation to the technology-mediated external world. To analyze this question, we draw from Michel Foucault's ethics of care of the self, which examines how the self is constituted through conscious and reflective work on self-transformation. We present three case studies to illustrate how individuals carry out practices of the self to reflect upon and negotiate their relationship with technology. We discuss the importance of examining the self and foreground the notion of care of the self in HCI research and design."
w,"This paper is in response to the manuscript entitled Ethical oversight of student data in learning analytics: a typology derived from a cross-continental, cross-institutional perspective (Willis et al., Educ Technol Res Dev 64(5):881-901, 2016) from an ethical perspective. The impact of the article is that it offered a working typology of ethical approaches and aims to determine the ethical intersection of internal student data usage and application. Their review of ethical approaches included research institutions from three continents. Findings from this review have implications for applied research with student data. This is particularly interesting given the differences in ethical approaches in the United States (more utilitarian) and the European Union's rather strict deontological approach. While learning analytics offer rich student data for personalizing educational technologies, there is associated potential for threats to autonomy and privacy. A limitation of the topology is that it did not include other people groups (e.g., Asia, South America, Australia). Future learning analytics, design, application, and research will need to consider both where the technologies were developed and where educational technologies are being applied."
w,"Availability of humungous visual data and increasing in generation of visual data in Security and Surveillance domain made a pathway to Computer Vision algorithms. The existing algorithms are not precise enough for predictive analytics. Sensitive use cases such as action recognition and identifying missing people in huge crowds has thrown a challenging research of drawing accurate and precise results. The existing 2-D plots for action recognition have failed due to unstructured visual data available where the accuracy is around <50%. Due to unstructured visual data, the existing 3-D plots often get overlapped with each other. Although the accuracy is noted >90% which maps it to False Positives. The existing solutions deals with object detection through Boolean logic then Pose Plots are mapped. Our research focus in on reverse engineer the existing solutions by applying smart segmentation to isolate background and then map the pose formula to detect the action. Our proposed solution obliterates the over-lap complications and unravels the False Positives. Our proposed solution achieved accuracy and precision of mAP> 0.8 for both images and video feeds."
w,"Purpose This study aims to understand pumpkin waste awareness among people by converting unstructured quantitative data into insightful information to understand the public's awareness of pumpkin waste during Halloween. Design/methodology/approach To fulfil the study's purpose, we extracted Halloween-related tweets by employing #halloween and #pumpkin hashtags and then investigated Halloween-related tweets via a topic modelling approach, specifically Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The tweets were collected from the UK between October 25th and November 7th, 2020. The analysis was completed with 11,744 tweets. Findings The topic modelling results revealed that people are aware of the pumpkin waste during Halloween. Furthermore, people tweet to reduce pumpkin waste by sharing recipes for using leftover pumpkins. Originality/value The study offers a novel approach to convert social media data into meaningful knowledge about public perception of food waste. This paper contributes to food waste literature by revealing people's awareness of pumpkin waste during Halloween using social media analytics. Norm activation model and communicative ecology theory are used for the theoretical underpinning of topic modelling."
w,"Twitter is a popular means to disseminate information and currently more than 300 million people are using it actively. Software engineers are no exception; Singer et al. have shown that many developers use Twitter to stay current with recent technological trends. At various time points, many users are posting microblogs (i.e., tweets) about the same topic in Twitter. We refer to this reasonably large set of topically-coherent microblogs in the Twitter space made at a particular point in time as an event. In this work, we perform an exploratory study on software engineering related events in Twitter. We collect a large set of Twitter messages over a period of 8 months that are made by 79,768 Twitter users and filter them by five programming language keywords. We then run a state-of-the-art Twitter event detection algorithm borrowed from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain. Next, using the open coding procedure, we manually analyze 1,000 events that are identified by the NLP tool, and create eleven categories of events (10 main categories + others). We find that external resource sharing, technical discussion, and software product updates are the hottest categories. These findings shed light on hot topics in Twitter that are interesting to many people and they provide guidance to future Twitter analytics studies that develop automated solutions to help users find fresh, relevant, and interesting pieces of information from Twitter stream to keep developers up-to-date with recent trends."
w,"Social meetings provide important venues for people to get connected. However, it is challenging to explore reasons of social gathering, identify its key impact factors, and further use it to support people's social activities. In this paper, we present an embodied visual analytics system, which highlights analyzing and displaying social-cluster related information in real time. In the system, each user represents a data point in a high-dimensional dataset, and their positions reflect a 2D projection of the dataset, by using weighted multidimensional scaling. As users move and socialize with others, the 2D projection is dynamically updated, and relevant information of user clusters is visually analyzed and presented through dimension reduction techniques. We conducted informal social meetings with participants who were a mix of strangers and friends. We found that there are 3 stages of social gathering, corresponding to different interactions in the system. Our results also suggest that the system assists social gathering with dimension reduction visualizations."
w,"Social media's pervasiveness has created new demands for openness, transparency, real-time communication, and public engagement in diplomacy. In this study, we analyze public engagement strategies for diplomacy on Twitter that were employed by a German ambassador. By applying a text analytics approach, we explored the ambassador's tweets' core themes, how people reacted to those tweets, and what type of topics received higher engagement for 2 years. Eight themes emerged from our analysis of the tweets: democracy, politics and law; society and culture; conflict and violence; personality; environment and health; economic and social development; personal life; and embassy affairs. By analyzing the tweets' content, we present a public engagement model (PEM) for social media communication by highlighting 3 key factors that promote online public engagement: self-disclosure, positive attitude, and inquisitiveness. Results suggest that over 2 years, the German ambassador was a highly engaging personality in Pakistan, with around 4,369 interactions and highlighted positive diplomatic communication on Twitter. Tweets were positive, courteous, respectful, personalized, interactive, and direct."

The hardware support for our solution is based on the newly introduced Google Coral development board having, as a prominent feature, the on-board Edge Tensor Processing Unit, capable of execute state-of-the-art mobile vision models such as MobileNet v2 at 100+ FPS, in a power efficient manner. The Google Coral is proven to outperform competing Machine Learning hardware accelerators currently available on the market and so represents the best accuracy/power efficiency choice. The software part includes some deep learning-based modules for video analytics such as detection, classification and tracking objects, including cars and people, using MobileNet + SSD architecture. Also, the experimental setup is described: compiling OpenCV for Google Coral, connecting to the video stream of the surveillance cameras. The system supports video equipment by any manufacturer by interfacing to it using Real Time Streaming Protocol/Open Network Video Interface Forum connections."
w,"A hospital information management system (Doctive) with habit-change features and medial analytical support for decision making is developed in this study to reduce the risks of heart diseases. Doctive is targeted for hospital authorities to monitor patients' habits and to prescribe medication and advice accordingly. Furthermore, this system provides emergency assistance for patients based on their current location. The proposed system would be beneficial for monitoring and organizing patients' information to ease data entry, data management, data access, data retrieval, and finally decision making. Doctive is tested and evaluated by 41 people who are either medical experts or professionals in the field of data analytics and visualization. The results indicate a high acceptance rate towards using the Doctive system in hospitals and a very good usability of the system. Doctive can be useful for healthcare providers and developers to track users' habits for reducing the risk of heart disease."
w,"In the modern era, digital data processing with a huge volume of data from the repository is challenging due to various data formats and the extraction techniques available. The accuracy levels and speed of the data processing on larger networks using modern tools have limitations for getting quick results. The major problem of data extraction on the repository is finding the data location and the dynamic changes in the existing data. Even though many researchers created different tools with algorithms for processing those data from the warehouse, it has not given accurate results and gives low latency. This output is due to a larger network of batch processing. The performance of the database scalability has to be tuned with the powerful distributed framework and programming languages for the latest real-time applications to process the huge datasets over the network. Data processing has been done in big data analytics using the modern tools HADOOP and SPARK effectively. Moreover, a recent programming language such as Python will provide solutions with the concepts of map reduction and erasure coding. But it has some challenges and limitations on a huge dataset at network clusters. This review paper deals with Hadoop and Spark features also their challenges and limitations over different criteria such as file size, file formats, and scheduling techniques. In this paper, a detailed survey of the challenges and limitations that occurred during the processing phase in big data analytics was discussed and provided solutions to that by selecting the languages and techniques using modern tools. This paper gives solutions to the research people who are working in big data analytics, for improving the speed of data processing with a proper algorithm over digital data in huge repositories."
w,"In the data analytics society, each individual's disclosure of personal information imposes costs on others. This disclosure enables companies, deploying novel forms of data analytics, to infer new knowledge about other people and to use this knowledge to engage in potentially harmful activities. These harms go beyond privacy and include difficult to detect price discrimination, preference manipulation, and even social exclusion. Currently existing, individual-focused, data protection regimes leave law unable to account for these social costs or to manage them. This Article suggests a way out, by proposing to re-conceptualize the problem of social costs of data analytics through the new frame of data management law. It offers a critical comparison of the two existing models of data governance: the American notice and choice approach and the European personal data protection regime (currently expressed in the General Data Protection Regulation). Tracing their origin to a single report issued in 1973, the Article demonstrates how they developed differently under the influence of different ideologies (market-centered liberalism, and human rights, respectively). It also shows how both ultimately failed at addressing the challenges outlined already forty-five years ago. To tackle these challenges, this Article argues for three normative shifts. First, it proposes to go beyond privacy and towards social costs of data management as the framework for conceptualizing and mitigating negative effects of corporations' data usage. Second, it argues to go beyond the individual interests, to account for collective ones, and to replace contracts with regulation as the means of creating norms governing data management. Third, it argues that the nature of the decisions about these norms is political, and so political means, in place of technocratic solutions, need to be employed."

Mining Minds embraces some of the most prominent digital technologies, ranging from Big Data and Cloud Computing to Wearables and Internet of Things, as well as modern concepts and methods, such as context-awareness, knowledge bases or analytics, to holistically and continuously investigate on people's lifestyles and provide a variety of smart coaching and support services. Results: This paper comprehensively describes the efficient and rational combination and interoperation of these technologies and methods through Mining Minds, while meeting the essential requirements posed by a framework for personalized health and wellness support. Moreover, this work presents a realization of the key architectural components of Mining Minds, as well as various exemplary user applications and expert tools to illustrate some of the potential services supported by the proposed framework. Conclusions: Mining Minds constitutes an innovative holistic means to inspect human behavior and provide personalized health and wellness support. The principles behind this framework uncover new research ideas and may serve as a reference for similar initiatives."
w,"For quite some time now, data have become the new oil of the digital industry. The spread and evolution of information technologies and connectivity between people and devices have enabled a new dimension of big-data storage and analytics that could bring major improvements across industries. In this paper, we propose a new, frequent itemset mining approach. The challenge is to apply traditional extraction techniques in a distributed environment. The main originality of our mining method is to take benefits of a performant existing algorithm and use a novel data structure to maintain frequent sequential patterns coupled with a quick pruning strategy. The proposed approach has been implemented using Spark to further improve the efficiency of iterative computation. Numeric experiment results using standard benchmark datasets by comparing the proposed algorithm with the existing algorithm, FP -Growth, demonstrate that our approach has better efficiency and scalability."

w,"Context Software engineering activities provide practitioners with large volumes of data that software analytics tools can use for many purposes, including defect prediction and effort estimation. However, the adoption of such tools depends on the information they provide and the real needs of practitioners. While existing research has focused on what developers need, the needs of managers are not well understood. Aims This study provides an in-depth analysis of the information needs of software practitioners from one organization that performs research, development, and innovation projects with industry partners. Understanding these practitioners' needs enables the development of better analytics solutions to support managerial decision-making. Method We interviewed practitioners in leadership positions and analyzed the collected data using Grounded Theory coding techniques, i.e., open and selective coding. Results We identified 19 software analytics use cases and classified them into four dimensions: quality, people, project management, and knowledge management. We also elicited several indicators to meet the identified use cases and captured key aspects concerning the organization's analytics scenario. Conclusions Although our results are particularly relevant to organizations similar to the one in which we conducted the study, they aim to serve as input for implementing new analytics solutions by practitioners and researchers in general."
w,"Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) territories are highly relevant to achieving sustainable lifestyles with human subsistence in balance with the ecosystem. The Barroso agro-sylvo-pastoral system is a clear example of this alignment between existing society, nature and natural resources, the environment, landscapes, and contextual heritage. Moreover, the sustainable use of existing natural resources, excellent environmental conditions, and breath-taking untouched landscapes represent a truly relevant factor towards the development of a region economy that is still greatly influenced by an engraved cultural, patrimonial, and agricultural heritage. Given the GIAHS classification attributed to that territory, the need arises to guarantee the existing environmental conditions. This context will allow the maintenance of the GIAHS classification, ensuring the quality of life in the region and stimulating its socio-economic development and overall sustainability. The present article describes a proposal for a digital ecosystem model aimed at the Barroso GIAHS, composed of four main functional hubs that actively interact with each other: smart environment, smart government, smart economy, and smart people. Based on wireless sensor networks, IoT, artificial intelligence, data analytics, and other technological solutions, this solution will allow real-time control of the territory's environmental conditions and develop more efficient and well-supported management and governance."
w,"A field of personal analytics has emerged around self-monitoring practices, which includes the visualization and interpretation of the data produced. This paper explores personal analytics from the perspective of self-optimization, arguing that the ways in which people confront and engage with visualized personal data are as significant as the technology itself. The paper leans on the concept of the. data double.: the conversion of human bodies and minds into data flows that can be figuratively reassembled for the purposes of personal reflection and interaction. Based on an empirical study focusing on heart-rate variability measurement, the discussion underlines that a distanced theorizing of personal analytics is not sufficient if one wants to capture affective encounters between humans and their data doubles. Research outcomes suggest that these explanations can produce permanence and stability while also profoundly changing ways in which people reflect on themselves, on others and on their daily lives."

Significant societal problems are increasing risk to young people, including exploitation and violent crime associated with gang culture and drugs. A predictive analytics system is being implemented to support the delivery of contextual safeguarding, where the interplay of the school, peer, family and community environments determine the safeguarding risk. Due to the intense level of human activity required by safeguarding teams to identify and intervene with those at risk, Bayesian network risk modelling is being integrated with traditional analytics to extend and augment human capacity. The participants are keenly aware of the potential for harm from this data; in its collation, appropriateness of methods, accuracy and validity of output, and the human interpretation and resulting actions and impact on young people."
w,"The design of visual analytics tools for facilitating humandata interaction (HDI) plays a key role to help people identifying useful knowledge from large masses of data. Designing data visualization based on guidelines is relevant. However, it is necessary to further promote the engagement of people in evaluation activities in the design process. Stakeholders need to comprehend the guidelines to help with the evaluation results and design decisions. In this paper, we propose participatory evaluation practices based on HDI design guidelines. The practices aim to create the conditions to participants from any profile collaborate with the design guidelines evaluation. The practices were used on a design problem involving interactions with coordinated visualization. The context of application was a visual analytic tool supporting decisions related to the production strategy in oil reservoirs with the participation of key stakeholders. The results indicate that participants were able to understand the design guidelines and took advantage from them in the design decisions."
w,"The increasing electoral abstention of young people is a global problem that has raised concerns both inside and outside the academy. However, recent research suggests that young people are significantly more likely to vote when causes or issues close to them are at stake. This article explores the influence of context (Covid-19 and far-right populism) on youth voter turnout. Using a triangulation of methods, data were collected both via a survey (n = 350) answered by a representative sample of young Portuguese people between 18 and 29 years old and through social media analytics (n = 2.373), analyzing the activity of users in the same age group on Twitter during the 2021 Presidential Election in Portugal. The results point to a strong mobilization power of the rise of far-right populism in young people's turnout, who demonstrate a willingness to express their opposition to these movements through voting. On the contrary, Covid-19 does not seem to be a mobilizing topic that young adults are passionate about, but it influences the electoral moment in two ways: negatively, by making it difficult or impossible to vote; positively, by reinforcing attention to the election campaign."
w,"Introduction: The OneTouch Verio Reflect((R)) (OTVR) Blood Glucose Meter features a color range indicator and provides on-meter guidance, insights, and encouragement. Diabetes management is enhanced by the OneTouch Reveal((R)) (OTR) Mobile App. We sought to provide real-world evidence (RWE) that combining devices improves glycemia. Methods: Anonymized glucose and app analytics from more than 55,000 people with diabetes (PWDs) were extracted from a server. Data from their first 14 days using OTVR Meter and OTR App was compared with 14 days prior to 90- and 180-day timepoints using paired within-subject differences. Results: In people with type 1 (PwT1D) or type 2 diabetes (PwT2D), readings in-range (RIR 70-180 mg/dL) improved by 7.8 percentage points (57.9-65.7%) and 12.0 percentage points (72.8-84.8%), respectively, over 180 days and hyperglycemia (> 180 mg/dL) was reduced by - 8.4 percentage points (37.9-29.5%) and - 12.2 percentage points (26.2-14.1%). RIR improved by > 10 percentage points in 38% of PwT1D and 39% of PwT2D. PwT1D spending > 2 to 4 sessions or > 10 to 20 min per week on the app improved RIR by 7.0 and 8.2 percentage points, respectively. PwT2D spending > 2 to 4 sessions or > 10 to 20 min per week on the app improved RIR by 12.6 and 12.1 percentage points, respectively. In PwT1D or T2D, mean blood glucose reduced by - 14.3 and - 19.8 mg/dL, respectively, from baseline to 180 days, with no clinically meaningful changes in percentage of hypoglycemic readings ( < 70 mg/dL). PwT1D 65 years and older performed the most app sessions (10 per week) and improved RIR by 7.9 percentage points. PwT2D 65 years and older spent more time on the app (45 min per week) than PwT2D of any other age and improved RIR by 7.6 percentage points. All glycemic changes were statistically significant (p\ 0.0005). Conclusion: Real-world data from more than 55,000 PWDs demonstrates sustained improvements in readings in-range in PWDs using the OneTouch Verio Reflect Blood Glucose Meter and OneTouch Reveal App."
w,"Audience analytics and metrics are ubiquitous in today's media environment. However, little is known about how creative media workers come to understand the social norms related to those technologies. Drawing on social influence theory, this study examines formal and informal socialization mechanisms in U.S. newsrooms. It finds that editorial newsworkers express receiving a moderate amount of training on the use of analytics and metrics, which is typically provided by their organization; primarily look to people within the organization, and especially superiors, to understand the social norms; learn about those norms mostly through observation and communication about others' experiences with the technology rather than their own; and that experiences are influenced by the organizational context and the individual's position in the editorial hierarchy. This leads to a broader intervention to our understanding of the social structures and individual dispositions that influence how emerging technologies are experienced across organizational and institutional environments."
w,"Person re-identification using analysis of photographs and video footages has a myriad of applications ranging from surveillance to human analytics. Techniques have been developed for closed-set re-identification of people in footages based on prior knowledge of the persons such as photographs, body features or face recognition models. However, except for face recognition, such methods are often incapable of handling the open-set scenario of identifying new persons that are not included in the current set of known persons. Additionally, face recognition is often not a practical solution for analysis of surveillance quality footages due to poor resolution and non-visibility of face. Closed set to Open Set Person Re-Id Framework (C2OPR) we propose in this paper, is a technique that could be used to extend a closed set person re-identification system to support identification of new persons. This is a generic approach, which can be used to extend any closed-set re-identification system to support open set re-identification. Through rigorous testing and improvements, we have reached accuracy in excess of 78% for identifying new persons using closed-set multi-view person re-identification systems."
w,"Counting precisely the number of people in a crowd is one of the most attractive issues for video analytics application. In this paper, an integrated method using Histogram of Oriented Gradient HOG) and Completed Local Binary Pattern CLBP) is proposed to detect a head-shoulder region of people within image or video sequence. Head-shoulder region is used as features to detect people against the false positive and false negative issue. HOG and CLBP are used to extract the edge contour and texture features of head-shoulder region, respectively. The two features are fused together to generate a combined feature vector. Support Vector Machine SVM) is used to execute classification of the fusion features to classify people from a mixture of objects. The results show that the detection rate of the proposed method HOG-CLBP, on Recall value and Accuracy, achieves better performance compared to the current method for dense crowd scenario."
w,"Mobility is central to urbanity, and urbanity is central to our common future as the world's population crowds into urban areas. This is creating a global urban mobility crisis due to the unsustainability of our 20th century transportation systems for an urban world. Fortunately, the science and planning of urban mobility is transforming away from infrastructure as the solution towards a sustainable mobility paradigm that manages rather than encourages travel, diminishes mobility and accessibility inequities, and reduces the harms of mobility to people and environments. In this essay, I discuss the contributions over the past decade of movement analytics to sustainable mobility science and planning. I also highlight two major challenges to sustainable mobility that should be addressed over the next decade."
w,"In dialogue analysis, characterising named entities in the domain of interest is relevant in order to understand how people are making use of them for argumentation purposes. The movie recommendation domain is a frequently considered case study for many applications and by linguistic studies and, since many different resources have been collected throughout the years to describe it, a single database combining all these data sources is a valuable asset for cross-disciplinary investigations. We propose an integrated graph-based structure of multiple resources, enriched with the results of the application of graph analytics approaches to provide an encompassing view of the domain and of the way people talk about it during the recommendation task. While we cannot distribute the final resource because of licensing issues, we share the code to assemble and process it once the reference data have been obtained from the original sources."

The SPaCe artificial intelligence engine predicts threats and critical events and proposes countermeasures by examining the daily flows of people and correlating different data and events, thanks to machine learning and big data analytics. All this massive data comes from a pervasive smart camera network that constantly monitors activities in stations, trains, buses and other places of interest. In this work, we present the idea of this computer vision distributed sub-system, the state of the art of the techniques involved and the advanced functionalities that this intelligent surveillance system offers to the upper layers. Everything is developed following the privacy-by-design paradigm; namely, no real image is recorded or transmitted, but all the elaborations take place on the edge nodes of the system."

Compared with image-based action recognition, videos provide much more information, reducing the ambiguity of actions. In the last decade, many works focus on datasets, novel models and learning approaches have improved video action recognition to a higher level. However, there are challenges and unsolved problems, in particular in sports analytics where data collection and labeling are more sophisticated, requiring people with domain knowledge and even sport professionals to annotate data. In addition, the actions could be extremely fast and it becomes difficult to recognize them. Moreover, in team sports like football and basketball, one action could involve multiple players, and to correctly recognize them, we need to analyze all players, which is relatively complicated. In this paper, we present a survey on video action recognition for sports analytics. We introduce more than ten types of sports, including team sports, such as football, basketball, volleyball, hockey and individual sports, such as figure skating, gymnastics, table tennis, tennis, diving and badminton. Then we compare numerous existing frameworks for sports analysis to present status quo of video action recognition in both team sports and individual sports. Finally, we discuss the challenges and unsolved problems in this area and to facilitate sports analytics, we develop a toolbox using PaddlePaddle, which supports football, basketball, table tennis and figure skating action recognition."
w,"Decision makers are exposed to an increasing amount of information. Algorithms can help people make better data-driven decisions. Previous research has focused on both companies' orientation towards analytics use and the required skills of individual decision makers. However, each individual can make either analytically based or intuitive decisions. The authors investigated the characteristics that influence the likelihood of making analytical decisions, focusing on both analytical orientation and capabilities of individuals. They conducted a survey using 462 business students as proxies for decision makers and used partial least squares path modeling to show that analytical capabilities and analytical orientation influence each other and affect analytical decision-making, thereby impacting decision quality and decision regret. The findings suggest that when implementing business analytics solutions, companies should focus on the development not only of technological capabilities and individuals' skills but also of individuals' analytical orientation."
w,"A top view camera having wide range lens installed overhead of the objects contributes greatly toward resolving the tracking problem and also maintains comprehensive visual access of the environment. Video analytics becoming more important to Internet of Things applications including automatic people monitoring and surveillance systems. We followed an approach based on machine learning features-based person tracking algorithm in industrial environment. The algorithm implements simple motion detection framework through motion blobs. The algorithm, rHOG uses the history of already imaged/blobed population with the anticipated blob position of the person observed. We have compared our results, acquired through five varying test sequences, with established algorithms used for object tracking. The results highlight that our algorithm beats others tracking algorithms by greater margins. The accuracy depicted in our results shows 99% of accuracy compared to the last known best algorithm, the mean shift algorithm, yielding 48% accuracy in result. Furthermore, unlike other blob-based tracking algorithms, our algorithm has additional property to discriminate any blob as a person or no person. Our proposed tracking algorithm has the additional advantage of detecting stationary person for a long time, handling occlusion, abrupt change in the environment, and keeps performing the tracking by compensating for the gaps in data pertaining to all the frames."
w,"This study aimed to investigate the disparities and inequalities in food accessibility in colonial Seoul (Keijo in Japanese, and Gyeongseong in Korean) in the 1930s, using a geographic information system (GIS) and open-source transport analytics tools. We specifically focused on the unique social standing of people in the colonial era, namely colonial rulers (Japanese) vs. subjects (Koreans) and examined whether neighborhoods with larger proportions of colonial rulers had more access to food opportunities. For a comprehensive evaluation, we computed food accessibility by multiple transport modes (e.g., public transit and walking), as well as by different time budgets (e.g., 15 minutes and 30 minutes) and considered various sets of food options-including rice, meat, seafood, general groceries, vegetables, and fruits-when measuring and comparing accessibility across neighborhoods in colonial Seoul. We took a novel digital humanities approach by synthesizing historical materials and modern, open-source transport analysis tools to compute cumulative opportunity-based accessibility measures in 1930s colonial Seoul. The results revealed that Japanese-dominant neighborhoods had higher accessibility by both public transit and walking than Korean-dominant neighborhoods. The results further suggest that inequality and disparity in food accessibility is observed not only in contemporary society but also in the 1930s, indicating a historically rooted issue."
w,"Supply chain researchers are confronted with a dizzying array of research questions, many of which are not mutually independent. This research was motivated by the need to map the landscape of research themes, identify potential overlapping areas and interactions, and provide guidelines on areas of focus for researchers to pursue. We conducted a three-phase research study, beginning with an open-ended collection of opinions on research themes collected from 102 supply chain management (SCM) researchers, followed by an evaluation of a consolidated list of themes by 141 SCM researchers. These results were then reviewed by 10 SCM scholars. Potential interactions and areas of overlap were identified, classified, and integrated into a compelling set of ideas for future research in the field of SCM. We believe these ideas provide a forward-looking view on those themes that will become important, as well as those that researchers believe should be focused on. While areas of research deemed to become most important include big data and analytics, the most under-researched areas include efforts that target the people dimension of SCM, ethical issues and internal integration. The themes are discussed in the context of current developments that the authors believe will provide a valuable foundation for future research."
w,"As the fourth industrial revolution and information and communication technology base are growing and the Internet of Things is distributed, a newly set goal is to use the energy of various industries efficiently. This paper is a study to solve the energy consumption problem and to use it efficiently. Specifically, sensors inside the device and ARM embedded boards are used to identify energy usage, store energy efficiency in real time in cloud services, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and leverage Grafana, a data analytics tool to visualize and present to users. It also provides intelligent energy data to people, providing them with the ability to use energy more effectively than traditional methods. Through this process, energy information is identified in real life by mobile and Personal Computer (PC) and prevent and monitor energy consumption that is not efficient."
w,"Large transportation hubs are difficult to navigate, especially for people with special needs such as those with visual impairment, Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or simply those with navigation challenges. The primary objective of this research is to design and develop a novel cyber-physical infrastructure that can effectively and efficiently transform existing transportation hubs into smart facilities capable of providing better location-aware services. We investigated the integration of a number of internet of the things (IoT) elements, including video analytics, Bluetooth beacons, mobile computing, and facility semantic models, to provide reliable indoor navigation services to people with special needs, yet requiring minimum infrastructure changes. Our pilot tests with people with special needs at a multi-floor building in New York City has demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework."
w,"Social media has become a new and main platform for organizations to broadcast their policies, for companies to advertise their products, and for people to propagate their opinions. Therefore, social media data analytics has become a timely and significant research topic in recent years. In this talk, Dr. Li will first go through the social media background and the data representation of social media data. And then, he will briefly discuss the main stream research in social data mining and social computing. After that, Dr. Li will mainly introduce how the two most popular influence models are defined in social computing, what the influence maximization problem is defined, how its variants are defined. Particularly, in this talk, Dr. Li will focus more on the traditional influence maximization, topic-awareness influence maximization, time-constrained influence maximization, location-awareness influence maximization, target-awareness influence maximization, and the community-level influence maximization. Finally, Dr. Li will introduce his current social media research project and discuss the interesting collaboration with attendees. This one-hour keynote targets researchers, designers and practitioners interested in social computing, social media data analytics, big data management systems and processing. While the audience with a good background in these areas would benefit most from this keynote, we believe the material to be presented would give general audience and newcomers an introductory pointer to the current work and important research topics in this field of viral marketing and social influence maximization, and inspire them to learn more. Only preliminary knowledge about graph, data mining, algorithms and their applications are needed."
w,"Social networking services (SNSs) have become the main avenue, where people speak their thoughts. Accordingly, we can explore people's thoughts by analyzing topics in SNS. When do topics change? Do they ever come back? What do people mainly talk about? In this study, we design and propose a novel visual analytics system to answer these interesting questions. We abstract the topic per unit time as a point in a two-dimensional space through document embedding and dimensionality reduction techniques and provide supplemented charts that represent words appearing at a certain time and the time-series change of word occurrence over the entire period. We employ a novel text visualization technique, called semantic preserving word bubbles, to visualize words at a certain time. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system using Twitter data about early COVID-19 trends in Japan. We propose our system to help users to explore and understand transitions in posted contents on SNS."
w,"The use of analytics has been emerging as a way to better understand the complex dynamics and resulting trends that occur when social and technical systems intersect. For instance, web analytics studies the intersection between society and the Internet to better understand use patterns and preferences. Business analytics studies the interfaces between human capital and technical systems in the context of corporate management and industrial production. Engineering design is ripe with such sociotechnical systems where consumers and engineered systems intersect producing a complex sociotechnical system marked by difficult to predict behavior and trends. In this paper, the paradigm of design analytics is further developed and used to study a diverse sociotechnical product. The product is a refrigerator that is hypothetically equipped with sensors and feedback mechanisms, and a simulator models the interactions of a population of 1000 users. Analyzing this sociotechnical product using design analytics demonstrates the ability to extract valuable insights at the juncture of people and technology. Insights into the leading behaviors of different populations are presented, and it is shown that design analytics and the associated tools can provide a platform for designers to develop better performing products that meet both explicit and implicit customer needs."
w,"Identifying coordinated relationships is an important task in data analytics. For example, an intelligence analyst might want to discover three suspicious people who all visited the same four cities. Existing techniques that display individual relationships, such as between lists of entities, require repetitious manual selection and significant mental aggregation in cluttered visualizations to find coordinated relationships. In this paper, we present BiSet, a visual analytics technique to support interactive exploration of coordinated relationships. In BiSet, we model coordinated relationships as biclusters and algorithmically mine them from a dataset. Then, we visualize the biclusters in context as bundled edges between sets of related entities. Thus, bundles enable analysts to infer task-oriented semantic insights about potentially coordinated activities. We make bundles as first class objects and add a new layer, in-between, to contain these bundle objects. Based on this, bundles serve to organize entities represented in lists and visually reveal their membership. Users can interact with edge bundles to organize related entities, and vice versa, for sensemaking purposes. With a usage scenario, we demonstrate how BiSet supports the exploration of coordinated relationships in text analytics."
w,"We introduce the BDA dynamics and explore the associated applications in renewable energy sector with a focus on data-driven innovation. Our study draws on the exponential growth of renewable energy initiatives over the last decades and on the paucity of literature to illustrate the use of BDA in the energy industry. We conduct a qualitative field study in the UK with stakeholder interviews and analyse our results using thematic analysis. Our findings indicate that no matter if the importance of the energy sector for 'people's well-being, industrial competitiveness, and societal advancement, old fashioned approaches to analytics for organisational processes are currently applied widely within the energy sector. These are triggered by resistance to change and insufficient organisational knowledge about BDA, hindering innovation opportunities. Furthermore, for energy organisations to integrate BDA approaches, they need to deal with challenges such as training employees on BDA and the associated costs. Overall, our study provides insights from practitioners about adopting BDA innovations in the renewable energy sector to inform decision-makers and provide recommendations for future research."
w,"Internet of Things (IoT); the new dawn technology that describes how data, people and interconnected physical objects act based on communicated information, and big data analytics have been adopted by diverse domains for varying purposes. Manufacturing, agriculture, banks, oil and gas, healthcare, retail, hospitality, and food services are few of the sectors that have adopted and massively utilized IoT and big data analytics. The transportation industry is also an early adopter, with significant attendant effects on its processes of tracking shipment, freight monitoring, and transparent warehousing. This is recorded in countries like England, Singapore, Portugal, and Germany, while Malaysia is currently assessing the potentials and researching a purpose-driven adoption and implementation. This paper, based on review of related literature, presents a summary of the inherent prospects in adopting IoT and big data analytics in the Malaysia transportation system. Efficient and safe port environment, predictive maintenance and remote management, boundary-less software platform and connected ecosystem, among others, are the inherent benefits in the IoT and big data analytics for the Malaysia transportation system."
w,"The indigenous peoples of Colombia have a considerable social, political and cultural wealth. However, issues such as the decades-long armed conflict and drug trafficking have posed a significant threat to their survival. In this work, publicly available documents on the Internet with information about two indigenous communities, the Awa and Inga people from the Cauca region in southern Colombia, are analysed using text analytics approaches. A corpus is constructed comprising general characterisation documents, media articles and rulings from the Constitutional Court. Topic analysis is carried out to identify the relevant themes in the corpus to characterise each community. Sentiment analysis carried out on the media articles indicates that the articles about the Inga tend to be more positive and objective than the Awa. This may be attributed to the significant impact that the armed conflict has had on the Awa in recent years, and the productive projects of the Inga. Furthermore, an approach for summarising long, complex documents by means of timelines is proposed, and illustrated using a ruling issued by the Constitutional Court. It is concluded that such an approach has significant potential to facilitate understanding of documents of this nature."
w,"Multicultural Youth Australia is a national 'census' of migrant youth in Australia aimed at tracking their social, cultural and economic status. The findings from this study highlight strong feelings of national belonging among migrant young people, despite significant experiences of racism. This article unpacks this paradox. It asks what migrant youth mean when they say they belong in the face of persistent racialised exclusion. In Hage's account of liberal multiculturalism, these feelings of belonging despite national rejection are explained as an acquiescence to the structures of white nationhood. This article develops an alternative analysis by drawing on place-based, reflexive accounts of youth belonging and scholarship on everyday multiculturalism. It extends these approaches by proposing a pragmatic analytics of belonging, foregrounding the practical and political contexts in which migrant young people's statements of belonging are put to work. It understands these belonging claims as practices of provisional citizenship, and aligns these claims with Arendt's notion of 'action' to highlight their potential as open-ended, critical engagements with the nation."
w,"The significant growth in the education sector promoted many innovations based on teaching and training the learners. Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) system has helped people with neural disorders learn for years. Still, it meets significant challenges that affect the rate of Language learning skills, specifically English. Big Data Analytics integrated AAC Framework (BDA-AACF) is proposed to train the English language for people with neural disorder. BDA-AACF collects all the language data and segregates it according to its usages. In the AAC system, symbols and letters are viewed, in which the user selects the required data using eyeball tracking assistance. BDA-AACF uses a predictive model to generate all optional sentences to choose from options. The preferred choice is converted into TEXT-SPEECH model for the listener to listen and vice versa. Simulation analysis shows that the proposed BDA-AACF recognizes the sentences and predicts the word-formation with improved sensitivity factors, stability, and response rate following conventional methods."
w,"In sport there has been a reluctance to adopt new forms of technology unless it is associated with improving performance. However, in recent times, professional sport bodies have commenced using enterprise systems and data analytics for off-field activities. The authors use a case study approach in the paper to document the manner in which the National Football League (NFL) made available its vast array of historical and contemporary data to Fantasy Football participants through the adoption of an enterprise system that included in-memory processing and data analytics capabilities. Through a new player comparison tool, optimum player selections are made, enabling people to make more informed decisions on the management of their fantasy team. Furthermore, by making available its unique assortment of data to fantasy players, the NFL was able to expand its Fantasy Football platform. The paper provides insight into how other sporting bodies might be able to leverage their data capabilities."
w,"This research aims to develop a bus load monitoring system that can perform image analytics. It proposes a solution in the current unsystematic operation of PUBs in the Philippines. Moreover, it serves as a stepping stone to develop a better and more organized bus system where management of passenger flow is well-handle and passengers are assured of security and convenience. Security system and passenger convenience are achieved with the use of cameras installed in the bus and web-based system is created to display information about the bus status. Bus status are updated using image analytics. Information such as number of seats available, seat occupied, number of people standing, total number of passengers inside the bus are displayed on the web-based monitoring system. The system is designed by using eleven cameras, one for the computation of the number of passengers entering/exiting the bus, ten cameras for the determination of the passenger seated and standing. The image analytics computations such as optical flow, FAST, and blob analysis were implemented using myRIO. The algorithm was able to achieve an accuracy of 97.3%."
w,"The process of interacting and executing agent-based simulations of human phenomena is complex and difficult to follow for lay people. This is due to 1) limited access to computing power, 2) difficulty in writing analytics scripts and 3) the size and complexity of the simulation space. Consequently, agent-based simulations are normally used once to answer a limited set of questions instead of exploring all the potential paths that the model offers. Here, we describe an approach for developing user experiences that automate the analytic process and rely on interactive visualizations and life histories of societies and agents. This approach helps the user visualize simulation results, pin-point consequences of different initial conditions on the societies' evolution and agents' behavior, and ultimately allow the user to build a narrative or storytelling to present complex information. We present a prototype application that we implemented in the R language."
w,"With the pervasiveness of monitoring cameras installed in public places, schools, hospitals and homes, video analytics technologies for interpreting the generated video content are becoming more and more relevant to people's lives. Along this context, we develop a human-centric video surveillance system that identifies and tracks people in a given scene. In this paper, a parallel processing pipeline is proposed that integrates image processing modules in the system, such as face detection, person recognition and tracking, efficiently and smoothly, so that multiple people can be simultaneously tracked in real time. Furthermore, significant innovations are involved in this work in making each of the major image analysis modules both fast and robust to variations in pose, illumination, occlusions and so on. A demonstration software has been implemented that supports finding, tagging, identifying and tracking people in live or recorded videos with uncontrolled capturing conditions."
w,"Social media provides big data for researchers to perform real-time analytics, as digital ethnographers, on what places and attributes people value in the historic urban landscapes they live or visit, enough to share with their social network. However, the use of these data to further our knowledge on heritage and their values, or to support heritage planning and management is still very limited. This article proposes a methodology for the analysis of viewpoints location-view scenes-tags data for photos posted on Flickr to provide insights into all facets of the perceived landscape character that identifies people-centered heritage at the city level. The analysis visualizes convergence and divergence between locals' and tourists' preferences. It also reveals heritage concerns in the context of daily-life practices and everyday landscape, as well as political and religious concerns in post-conflict areas. Additionally, the analysis questions the limits of heritage areas and categories used for identifying cultural values. Results showed that the different analyses complement one another to eventually provide insights into everyday encounters with the historic urban landscape. They also show the difference between experts' and users' documentation and characterization languages when defining heritage. When the first apply domain-specific classification models, the latter express personal reflections without following a specific hierarchy or a closed categorical system. It is believed that the outcome can help heritage scholars to further our understanding for the diversity of heritage places and attributes, as well as, heritage professionals, to inform decision-making processes in heritage planning and management on both experts' and users' understanding of heritage.

w,"A need exists to accurately estimate overdose risk and improve understanding of how to deliver treatments and interventions in people with opioid use disorder in a way that reduces such risk. We consider opportunities for predictive analytics and routinely collected administrative data to evaluate how overdose could be reduced among people with opioid use disorder. Specifically, we summarise global trends in opioid use and overdoses; describe the use of big data in research into opioid overdose; consider the potential for predictive modelling, including machine learning, for prevention and monitoring of opioid overdoses; and outline the challenges and risks relating to the use of big data and machine learning in reducing harms that are related to opioid use. Future research for improving the coverage and provision of existing interventions, treatments, and resources for opioid use disorder requires collaboration of multiple agencies. Predictive modelling could transport the concept of stratified medicine to public health through novel methods, such as predictive modelling and emulated trials for evaluating diagnoses and prognoses of opioid use disorder, predicting treatment response, and providing targeted treatment recommendations."
w,"Accessibility is a key concept in transportation research and an important indicator of people's quality of life. With the development of big data analytics, dynamic accessibility that captures the temporal variations of accessibility becomes an important research focus. Few prior studies focus on comparative measures of dynamic accessibility to Points of Interest (POIs) by alternative travel modes. To fill this research gap, we propose a new index called dynamic modal accessibility gap (DMAG), which draws upon available data on residents' real travel routes using different travel modes, as well as the data on POIs. We study the DMAG in the real-travel covered area, assuming POIs are only useful if it is within someone's real-travel covered area. We then apply this DMAG methodology to Shanghai's central city and peripheral area. In both cases, we measure the accessibility for public and private travel modes. As an example, one-week taxi GPS and metro smart card data, and POIs data are used to generate the DMAG index for 30-minute and 60-minute trip durations for weekdays and holidays. Results show that DMAG can reflect the pattern of temporal variations. The proposed DMAG analytical framework, which can be applied at both the user and the system levels, can support urban and transportation planning, and promote social equity and livability."
w,"Despite the large number of technology-intensive organisations, their corporate know-how and underlying workforce skill are not mature enough for a successful rollout of Artificial Intelligence (AI) services in the near-term. However, things have started to change, owing to the increased adoption of data democratisation processes, and the capability offered by emerging technologies for data sharing while respecting privacy, protection, and security, as well as appropriate learning-based modelling capabilities for non-expert end-users. This is particularly evident in the energy sector. In this context, the aim of this paper is to analyse AI and data democratisation, in order to explore the strengths and challenges in terms of data access problems and data sharing, algorithmic bias, AI transparency, privacy and other regulatory constraints for AI-based decisions, as well as novel applications in different domains, giving particular emphasis on the energy sector. A data democratisation framework for intelligent energy management is presented. In doing so, it highlights the need for the democratisation of data and analytics in the energy sector, toward making data available for the right people at the right time, allowing them to make the right decisions, and eventually facilitating the adoption of decentralised, decarbonised, and democratised energy business models."
w,"Introduction: The lifestyle of patients with hypertension is an important factor in treating hypertension, but in fact, the lifestyle of patients with hypertension is still quite bad. A bad lifestyle triggers complications and increases the prevalence of hypertension. The purpose of the study was to analyze the relationship between spiritual coping and the lifestyle of hypertension sufferers.Methods: The research method uses observational analytics, the independent variable is spiritual coping, the dependent variable is the lifestyle of people with hypertension, and the sampling technique uses simple random sampling. The sampled population is all hypertension sufferers in Ploso Kuning village who are between 26 to 65 years old, can read and are willing to be respondents. The sampling technique used is simple random sampling with a sample size of 108 respondents. Data analysis using Spearman rank correlation test.Results: The results showed that spiritual coping had a significant effect on the lifestyle of hypertension sufferers with a p-value of 0.000.Conclusion: The lifestyle of patients with hypertension can be improved by increasing the spiritual coping of the sufferer."
w,"The era of deep learning has enabled various dimensions of predictive and preventive healthcare in medical science. However, the applications in dimension are limited due to sparse availability of data and computing resources, also the required expertise of data understanding, modeling and training is not common yet. These limitations are forcing a barrier in the widespread use of deep learning applications in healthcare. In this research we propose a decentralized transfer learning mechanism based on smart contracts using private blockchain. The idea is to involve various stakeholders which includes data scientists, deep learning experts, dataset holders and deep learning infrastructure providers into a single trustless deep learning-based analytics system. The framework will allow sharing of data, and expertise in the field of deep learning, along with processing power to solve a single task in a decentralized manner. The sharing mechanism will be based on smart contracts to ensure the intellectual property of an individual remains protected. The framework once deployed on public blockchain can turn transfer learning into a new domain of research and business and will define a new era of shared computing for various domains. The research will directly impact people working in isolation to come together and create opportunities for better analytics and optimized predictions for scientific society."
w,"As a result of the new telecommunication ecosystem landscape, wireless communication has become an interdisciplinary field whose future is shaped by several interacting dimensions. These interacting dimensions, which form the cyber-physical convergence, closely link the technological perspective to its social, economic, and cognitive sciences counterparts. Beyond the current operational framework of the Internet of Things (IoT), network devices will be equipped with capabilities for learning, thinking, and understanding so that they can autonomously make decisions and take appropriate actions. Through this autonomous operation, wireless networking will be ushered into a paradigm that is primarily inspired by the efficient and effective use of (i) AI strategies, (ii) big data analytics, as well as (iii) cognition. This is the Cognitive Internet of People Processes Data and Things (CIoPPD&T), which can be defined in terms of the cyber-physical convergence. In this article, through the discussion of how the cyber-physical convergence and the interacting dynamics of the socio-technical ecosystem are enablers of digital twins (DTs), the network DT (NDT) is discussed in the context of 6G networks. Then, the design and realization of edge computing-based NDTs are discussed, which culminate with the vehicle-to-edge (V2E) use cases."
w,"Since the early 2000s, an ever growing online community of bloggers and amateur statisticians has been developing a new set of advanced analytics and performance metrics for the National Hockey League. Many of the people who are driving innovation in this field are not data scientists but, rather, intellectually curious fans of the game, who are playing a significant role in reshaping the way the game is consumed and understood. Yet, despite the body of knowledge created online, only within the last few years have the National Hockey League and the mainstream sport media begun to take notice of these innovations. I argue that the analytics movement is being driven from the fans up, rather than from the National Hockey League and other professional leagues down, and that the drivers of this movement are examples of what Antonio Gramsci calls 'organic intellectuals' - the analytics camp is locked into its own 'war of position' against the hegemony of traditional hockey fans, coaches, management and sport media. My research explores the resistance Internet-based content creators have experienced from established hockey media personalities ('Hockey Men') and the National Hockey League itself, connecting this resistance to a growing trend away from evidence-based discourse in the current Western media landscape."
w,"With the pervasiveness of monitoring cameras installed in public areas, schools, hospitals, work places and homes, video analytics technologies for interpreting these video contents are becoming increasingly relevant to people's lives. Among such technologies, human face detection and tracking (and face identification in many cases) are particularly useful in various application scenarios. While plenty of research has been conducted on face tracking and many promising approaches have been proposed, there are still significant challenges in recognizing and tracking people in videos with uncontrolled capturing conditions, largely due to pose and illumination variations, as well as occlusions and cluttered background. It is especially complex to track and identify multiple people simultaneously in real time due to the large amount of computation involved. In this paper, we present a survey on literature and software that are published or developed during recent years in the face tracking area. The survey covers the following topics: 1) mainstream and state-of-the-art face tracking methods, including features used to model the targets and metrics used for tracking; 2) face identification and face clustering from face sequences; and 3) software packages or demonstrations that are available for algorithm development or trial. A number of publically available databases for face tracking are also introduced."
w,"In March 2018, news of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal made headlines around the world. By inappropriately collecting data from approximately 87 million users' Facebook profiles, the data analytics company, Cambridge Analytica, created psychographically tailored advertisements that allegedly aimed to influence people's voting preferences in the 2016 US presidential election. In the aftermath of this incident, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with 30 participants based at a UK university, discussing their understanding of online privacy and how they manage it in the wake of the scandal. We analysed this data using an inductive (i.e. 'bottom-up') thematic analysis approach. Contrary to many opinions reported in the news, the respondents in our sample did not delete their accounts, frantically change their privacy settings, or even express that much concern. As a result, individuals often consider themselves immune to psychographically tailored advertisements, and lack understanding of how automated approaches and algorithms work in relation to their (and their networks') personal data. We discuss our findings in relation to wider related research (e.g. crisis fatigue, networked privacy, Protection Motivation Theory) and discuss directions for future research."
w,"This study aimed to examine the complex forces that influence the adoption of marketing analytics in the ready-made garments (RMG) industry in an emerging country context. The forces for change and those that impede the adoption of marketing analytics in the industry were explored. We used Lewis's Force Field Analysis framework to inform the research. Semi-structured interviews with managers, technology experts, and government officials were conducted using face-to-face and virtual meetings. The results reveal that RMG buyers' demand, competitors, lack of employee performance, and climate change issues are central forces pushing for implementing marketing analytics in the industry. However, the lack of knowledge, interest, and technology-skilled people, high cost, employee resistance, privacy issues, high employee turnover, and government policies are significant impediments to marketing analytics adoption in the RMG industry. The theoretical, organisational, policy, and professional implications are then discussed. Theoretically, this study contributes by creating a conceptual framework using Lewin's Force Field Analysis. In practical terms, this study suggests that marketing analytics in the Industry 4.0 era offers significant opportunities for businesses and policymakers to increase their flexibility, competitiveness and responsiveness."
w,"Background: The virtual environment has democratized information and research in the health area, especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Purpose: This study analyzed the boosting strategies of social networks and identified the most accessed posts from a previously developed and validated information portal aimed at people with disabilities. Methods: This quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive, exploratory study used Google Analytics (R) to collect data on origins and access numbers; boost data were obtained from the Facebook (R) and Instagram (R) networks themselves, after the end of each boost. Conclusions: Greater interest in publications related to the acquisition of rights for persons with disabilities and about COVID-19 was identified. The virtual environment, especially social networks in Brazil, proved to be a useful tool for disseminating information during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the importance of boosting access to health information. In addition, the investment in social networks was relevant due to the increase in the number of followers on the page. Implications for Practice: Social networks can be a valuable means of disseminating research, improving access to information based on scientific evidence in an inclusive way."
w,"Influence maximization, i.e., the problem of finding a small subset of nodes in a social network which can maximize the propagation of influence, has the potential to become a vital asset to identify and predict mental health related issues such as, predicting suicide, bulling, and radicalization. For example, predictive analytics in mental health can enable analyzing and exploring the factors involved in influencing people to participate in extremist activities. To address this challenge, in this paper, we analyze the influence maximization in mental health from effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability viewpoints. We present a social data analytics pipeline to enable analysts to engage with social data to explore the potential online radicalization. According to the predictive analytics, a particle swarm optimization influence maximization algorithm is proposed to facilitate selecting potential influential nodes. A context analytics algorithm is proposed to analyze the social data and the user activity patterns to learn how influence flows in social networks. We conducted intensive experiments based on real dataset and illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms."
w,"People using mobile devices for making phone calls, accessing the internet, or posting georeferenced contents in social media create episodic digital traces of their presence in various places. Availability of personal traces over a long time period makes it possible to detect repeatedly visited places and identify them as home, work, place of social activities, etc. based on temporal patterns of the person's presence. Such analysis, however, can compromise personal privacy. We propose a visual analytics approach to semantic analysis of mobility data in which traces of a large number of people are processed simultaneously without accessing individual-level data. After extracting personal places and identifying their meanings in this privacy-respectful manner, the original georeferenced data are transformed to trajectories in an abstract semantic space. The semantically abstracted data can be further analyzed without the risk of re-identifying people based on the specific places they attend."
w,"Media plays an important role in creating an impact in society. Several studies show that news media and entertainment channels, at times may create overwhelming images of the mental illness that emphasize criminality and dangerousness. The consequences of such negative impact may impact the audience with stigma and on the other hand, they impair the self-esteem and help-seeking behavior of the people with mental disorders. This is the first study to examine the Singapore media's portrayal of persons with mental disorders (MDs) using text analytics and natural language processing. To date, most studies on media portrayal of people with MDs have been conducted in developed Western countries. This study found that media articles on MDs in Singapore were largely negative in sentiment; even quotes from experts contain aspects of stigma. In addition, crime-related articles on MDs accounted for a significant portion of the corpus. Our model is also extended to detect positive health articles that discuss recovery and motivation. We further developed a stigma classifier based on the machine learning algorithms and text mining techniques. The classifier based on the XGBoosts performed best with an F1-score around 76%."
w,"BIM-based technologies can be strongly beneficial for construction sites management through platforms collecting data and providing analytics. These can be used to manage and control the people, materials and vehicles flows which create the complex organization of a medium and big construction site. IoT enables monitoring, controlling and actuating devices that are crucial to manage the site. Different typologies of sensors are available and some experimentations about how to simulate and thus predict critical issues in the construction site have been conducted. The experimentations, that are not presuming to be exhaustive, consider both indoor conditions and external situations verifiable through standard procedures. In the paper, four tests, developed in the virtual environment. The adopted workflow assumes the connection of the BIM (Building Information Modeling) authoring tool through a VPL (Visual Programming Language) to a database where data coming from the sensors are stored. The simulations shows the possible actuation of specific devices to correct possible critical situations that are commonly recurrent in construction sites and in the advanced one are implemented. The virtual experimental setups are show how to accomplish the work steps organization and how to visualize alerts and signals enabling the optimization and control of the construction site in a BIM environment. The advantages of this approach are strongly connected to risk and clash reduction in the construction site, increased safety for the workmen and environmental quality. Moreover, the possibility to control the warehouse conditions is highly beneficial to reduce the number of deteriorated materials with economic gains."
w,"Social media is Internet-based by design, allowing people to share content quickly via electronic means. People can openly express their thoughts on social media sites such as Twitter, which can then be shared with other people. During the recent COVID-19 outbreak, public opinion analytics provided useful information for determining the best public health response. At the same time, the dissemination of misinformation, aided by social media and other digital platforms, has proven to be a greater threat to global public health than the virus itself, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown. The public's feelings on social distancing can be discovered by analysing articulated messages from Twitter. The automated method of recognizing and classifying subjective information in text data is known as sentiment analysis. In this research work, we have proposed to use a combination of preprocessing approaches such as tokenization, filtering, stemming, and building N-gram models. Deep belief neural network (DBN) with pseudo labelling is used to classify the tweets. Top layers of the base classifiers are boosted in the pseudo labelling strategy, whereas lower levels of the base classifiers share weights for feature extraction. By introducing the pseudo boost mechanism, our suggested technique preserves the same time complexity as a DBN while achieving fast convergence to optimality. The pseudo labelling improves the performance of the classification. It extracts the keywords from the tweets with high precision. The results reveal that using the DBN classifier in conjunction with the bigram in the N-gram model outperformed other models by 90.3 percent. The proposed approach can also aid medical professionals and decision-makers in determining the best course of action for each location based on their views regarding the pandemic."
w,"This paper presents a novel approach to sensing both suspicious, and task-specific behaviours through the use of advanced computational intelligence techniques. Locating suspicious activity in surveillance camera networks is an intensive task due to the volume of information and large numbers of camera sources to monitor. This results in countless hours of video data being streamed to disk without being screened by a human operator. To address this need, there are emerging video analytics solutions that have introduced new metrics such as people counting and route monitoring, alongside more traditional alerts such as motion detection. There are however few solutions that are sufficiently robust to reduce the need for human operators in these environments, and new approaches are needed to address the uncertainty in identifying and classifying human behaviours, autonomously, from a video stream. In this work we present an approach to address the autonomous identification of human behaviours derived from human pose analysis. Behavioural recognition is a significant challenge due to the complex subtleties that often make up an action; the large overlap in cues results in high levels of classification uncertainty. False alarms are significant impairments to autonomous detection and alerting systems, and over reporting can lead to systems being muted, disabled, or decommissioned. We present results on a Computational-Intelligence based Behaviour Recognition (CIBR) that utilises artificial intelligence to learn, optimise, and classify human activity. We achieve this through extraction of skeleton recognition of human forms within an image. A type-2 Fuzzy logic classifier then converts the human skeletal forms into a set of base atomic poses (standing, walking, etc.), after which a Markov-chain model is used to order a pose sequence. Through this method we are able to identify, with good accuracy, several classes of human behaviour that correlate with known suspicious, or anomalous, behaviours."
w,"Background: COVID-19 and its public health response are having a profound effect on people's mental health. To provide support during these times, Canada's largest mental health and addiction teaching hospital (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health [CAMH]) launched the Mental Health and COVID-19 Pandemic website on March 18, 2020. This website was designed to be a nonstigmatizing psychoeducational resource for people experiencing mild to moderate distress due to COVID-19 and the public health response to the pandemic. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the reach, usability, and user perceptions of the CAMH Mental Health and COVID-19 Pandemic web site. Methods: This study used a mixed methods sequential explanatory design approach, which consisted of the following 2 distinct phases: (1) quantitative data collection and analysis and (2) qualitative semistructured interviews. In phase 1, we analyzed Google Analytics data to understand how many people visited the website and which were the most visited pages. We conducted a survey to identify users' sociodemographic backgrounds, and assess the usability of the website using the System Usability Scale and users' subjective stress levels using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). For phase 2, we conducted semistructured interviews to explore user experiences; user motivation, engagement, satisfaction, and perception of the stress reduction strategies; reflections of the website's functionality, ease of use, navigation, and design; and recommendations for improvement. Results: Google Analytics results showed 146,978 unique users from June 2020 to March 2021. Most users were from Canada (130,066, 88.5%). Between February 20, 2021, and June 4, 2021, 152 users completed the survey. Most users identified as white, female, and having at least a college degree. Based on the PSS-10 scores, most participants were experiencing moderate to high stress when they visited the website. Users rated the usability of the website as acceptable. Ten users completed in-depth interviews between May 2021 and June 2021. Positive feedback related to the content was that the website was a trustworthy source of mental health information with helpful evidence-based stress reduction strategies. Areas for improvement included the text heavy design of the website, wider dissemination/marketing, and greater accessibility of the website to meet the needs of diverse populations. Conclusions: Adding stress reduction resources to a website from a well-respected institution may be a practical method to increase awareness and access to evidence-based stress reduction resources during times of crisis, where there is severe disruption to usual health care contacts. Efforts to ensure that these resources are more widely accessed, especially by diverse populations, are needed."
w,"Background: The OneTouch Verio Reflect (OTVR) meter provides ColorSure Dynamic Range Indicator (DCRI) and Blood Sugar Mentor (BSM) features that are complemented by the OneTouch Reveal (OTR) mobile app. We sought to provide real-world evidence that these products support improved glycemic control.Methods: Anonymised glucose and app analytics were extracted from the LifeScan server for 4154 people with type 1 diabetes (PwT1D) and 13,623 people with type 2 diabetes (PwT2D). Data from their first 14 days were compared with the 14 days before the 90-day time point using paired within-subject differences.Results: Percentage glucose readings in range (RIR) 70-180 mg/dL improved by +8.1% (from 58% to 66.1%) in PwT1D and by +11.2% (from 72.4% to 83.6%) in PwT2D. Hyperglycemic readings (>180 mg/dL) reduced by -8.5% (from 37.1% to 28.6%) in PwT1D and by -11.3% (from 26.4% to 15.1%) in PwT2D. Mean glucose reduced on average by -14.5 mg/dL (from 174.8 to 160.2 mg/dL) in PwT1D and -18.2 mg/dL (from 157.8 to 139.6 mg/dL) in PwT2D. Glycemic improvement was strongly associated with OTR app engagement. Two to three sessions or 11 to 20 min/week in the app improved readings in range in PwT1D by +7.0% or +8.4%, respectively. Similar engagement trends for glycemic improvement were observed in PwT2D. Proportions of subjects achieving a 5% or 10% improvement in RIR were 46.9%/36.6% for PwT1D and 48.7%/37.7% for PwT2D.Conclusions: Real-world data from over 17,000 people with diabetes (PWDs) demonstrated significantly improved readings in range and reduced the burden of hyperglycemia in PWDs using the OTVR meter and OTR app."
w,"With the growth of internet, life of people have also changed. People share a huge amount of information on social media, thus increasing the amount of information at a very fast rate. This has made Social Data Analytics an important area of research. Analyzing the opinions or sentiments of people on the data shared can serve as a great means for making decisions in various domains. Also, not each and every data present on social media is correct as various people try to spread rumors, mostly just for fun. Due to this, it is required that there exist methods using which people can easily check information credibility of data concerning social media. The research carried out till now have mainly focused on tracking and modeling sentiments of public. This paper proposes a method for assessing the credibility of information by emulating the methods of topic and opinion classifications, primarily focusing on Twitter data. Improved Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm has been used for classification of topics within the tweets and semi-supervised method (SVM) has been used for sentiment analysis. Finally, majority decision by comparing the number of contrastive opinions about a topic is performed, for credibility analysis. Though, English and Hinglish languages have been used here, however, this method can be adapted easily to other languages since Twitter API allows specifying the language of the retrieved posts."
w,"The amount of data created in various sources over the Web is tremendously increasing. Trying to keep track of relevant sources is an increasingly time-consuming task. The traditional way of accessing information over the Web is pull-based. Users need to query data sources in certain time intervals where an important piece of information can be lately recognized or even missed completely. Technologies including RSS help users to get push-based notifications from websites. Discovering the relevant information without a notification overload is still not possible with existing technologies. Despite some promising efforts in push-based architectures to solve this problem, they fall short to meet the requirements in the big data era. In this study, by leveraging the latest advancements in distributed computing and big data analytics technologies, we use a focused crawling approach to propose a context aware notification architecture for people to find desired information at its most valuable state."
w,"With the ever increasing observations and measurements of geo-sensor networks, satellite imageries, geo-spatial data of location based services (LBS) and location-based social networks has become a serious challenge for data management and analysis systems. In urban micro-climate, we need to deal with various types of data such as: environmental data measurements, Wi-Fi data and so on. The format and the nature of data coming from different sensors such as temperature, humidity, thermal cameras, wind sensors, and others within an urban area varies. Therefore, there is a need for a unified platform to store these data efficiently using new technologies for which, we have come up with implementation of OLAP cubes. Furthermore, additional analytics for assessing urban thermal comfort can also be derived based on behavioural patterns of people. Therefore, outdoor Wi-Fi usage statistics is used as a proxy for the amount of time people spend outdoors, to correlate outdoor thermal conditions to perceived thermal comfort. Some interesting obervations are made in our study."
w,"The world is headed towards a new normal, while pandemic is continuing with new waves hitting nations. However, this storm will pass, but the choices we make now could change our lives for years to come. It is crucial to use new research perspectives bringing scientists and practitioners together to support decisions that would shape our future. This paper gives an example of consumer neuroscience and predictive analytics helping to go beyond rational verbatims to investigate real deep nonconscious convictions that people may not even be fully aware of and which cannot be covered by traditional opinion surveys. For example, public confidence in the healthcare system is related to pro-social behaviour and compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions during a crisis. The success in controlling pandemics depends on behaviour, and health officials need to persuade the population to make behaviour changes to ensure success. By providing comparative results from Portugal, this study highlights what changed in one year and what the population is not willing to admit by using the COVID-19 Fever project data collected and analysed with the iCode Smart Test in 2020 and 2021 and offers valuable data to support an effective communication strategy."
w,"The aim of this article is to provide the reader a documentary record on the subject of the technological infrastructure and the knowledge management of big data analytics and their relation to human rights. Currently, human rights violations around the world due to the indiscriminate use of big data analytics is a constant, since the information that is generated every day and every second by the use of technological devices -such as smartphones- makes possible the collection of information, that goes from consumption data to even private information, such as religious opinions or biometric data. Human rights violations due to big data analytics starts by the way personal data is collected and treated. Sometimes people do not know how their data are being processed, stored or used. As a result of the analysis, it was observed that several articles, books and papers refer to personal data and privacy regulations, focusing in the regulations of the data mining conditions. Despite, those regulations, it can be observed that big data analytics could allow a wide margin for infringement of not only the human right to privacy, but also of another human rights; for instance, through actions that promote racism, the creation of blacklists, the promotion of segregation and the limit of the freedom of speech, just to mention some examples."
w,"Connected medicine, using smart (software based and networked) medical devices is frequently presented as the major disruptive trend in health care. Such devices will however be broadly used only if they are prescribed by the hospitals as a part of a therapy and are reimbursed by the insurances. For this we need the proof of their safety, medical efficacy and economic efficiency. Aside of obligatory clinical trials we need an extensive system of post-market surveillance, because: a medical device is a part of a complex cyber-physical system, with humans in the loop/the environment cannot be sufficiently defined/humans react differently to the therapy, they also behave differently / after every software upgrade the device is not the same as before In their operation such devices generate huge amounts of data that can be reused for such analysis. Technically oriented people believe it can be done using a Big Data Analytics system without a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. It is doubtful if such approach can deliver useful results. The main problems seem to be: unbalanced cohort/various patient groups with various preferences/multiple quality parameters (basic algorithm, signal propagation, battery, security and privacy, obtrusiveness, etc.)/multiple variants (operating modes, device settings)/variability of the device and of the environment. When we transform data into actionable knowledge, especially if the generated decisions influence human health, utmost care has to be applied. The goal of this paper is to present the complexity of the problem, warn against hasty, purely technical solutions, raise interest among specialists in health statistics and ignite an interdisciplinary cooperation to solve it."
w,"The emergence of digitized health and physical education, or 'eHPE', embeds software algorithms in the organization of health and physical education pedagogies. Particularly with the emergence of wearable and mobile activity trackers, biosensors and personal analytics apps, algorithmic processes have an increasingly powerful part to play in how people learn about their own bodies and health. This article specifically considers the ways in which algorithms are converging with eHPE through the emergence of new health-tracking and biophysical data technologies designed for use in educational settings. The first half of the article provides a conceptual account of how algorithms 'do things' in the social world, and considers how algorithms are interwoven with practices of health tracking. In the second half, three key issues are articulated for further exploration: (1) health tracking as a 'biopedagogy' of bodily optimization based on data-led and algorithmically mediated understandings of the body; (2) health tracking as a form of pleasurable self-surveillance utilizing data analytics technologies to predict future bodily probabilities and (3) the ways that health-tracking produces a body encased in an 'algorithmic skin', connected to a wider 'networked cognitive system'. These developments and issues suggest the need for greater attention to how algorithmic systems are embedded in emerging eHPE technologies and pedagogies."
w,"Nowadays, the technology surrounds every corner of our lives and produces a huge amount of data about people and things' behaviours. This leads to a new sector of data analytics and decision making known as Big Data analytics era. In that era, the Internet of things (IoT) and the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play a vital role and allow to monitor a wide number of applications, zones and environments. However, the limited resources of devices along with the redundancy among collected data makes big data collection is a major challenge for such networks. In this paper, we propose a distributed round-based prediction model dedicated to hierarchical large-scale sensor networks. First, we divide the network lifetime into a set of rounds where each round consists of several periods. At each round, each sensor collects data for some periods of the round then it sends them to the next node then, it enters into sleep mode for the other periods of the round. Upon receiving the data from each sensor, the sink uses a prediction model based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) time series in order to expect sensor data during the sleeping mode. We applied our approach on real sensor data while the obtained results show its relevance in terms of reducing data transmission and saving network lifetime."
w,"The amount of cybersecurity-related information is extraordinarily increasing, given the fast-growing number of cybersecurity attacks and the significant influence brought by them. How to efficiently obtain and precisely understand the relevant knowledge in the sea of information on cybersecurity becomes a challenge. In this article, we propose an innovative cybersecurity retrieval scheme that supports automatic indexing and searching of cybersecurity information based on semantic contents and hidden metadata. The proposed scheme leverages a customized neural model that incorporates new linguistic features and word embedding by identifying the entities related to cybersecurity incidents from the text. We implement a novel cybersecurity search engine to demonstrate effective, understandable and pragmatic cybersecurity information retrieval based on the proposed schema. Comprehensive performance evaluation over real-world datasets has been conducted to validate the new algorithms and techniques developed for cybersecurity information retrieval. The new engine makes it possible to conduct augmented search, cybersecurity analytics, and visualization, with the ultimate goal of providing direct and efficient results to help people obtain and truly understand cybersecurity information."
w,"Pregnant people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a higher risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes compared with pregnant people without COVID-19. In 2021, large increases in maternal mortality were reported in Jamaica, almost half of which were attributable to COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination has been shown to reduce these risks, but low-and middle-income countries lack free, publicly available data, known as open data, on COVID-19 vaccine uptake for their pregnant populations. The objectives of this paper were to: review how high-income countries use open data to detect trends in COVID-19 vaccine uptake among pregnant people and develop vaccination distribution strategies; outline barriers to making open data available for maternal COVID-19 vaccination in the Caribbean; and propose a multipronged strategy that would increase the availability of open data on maternal COVID-19 vaccination in the Caribbean. A multipronged strategy to fill the data void would involve: (i) utilizing existing Caribbean maternal immunization data collection entities; (ii) adapting digital software tools to establish maternal electronic immunization registries; and (iii) collaborating with local partners skilled in data analytics. Making open data available for COVID-19 vaccine uptake among pregnant people in the Caribbean could offer substantial benefits, including the development of measurable maternal COVID-19 vaccination goals and the facilitation of vaccine decision-making discussions between providers and pregnant people."
w,"Recently, enterprises and governments invested aggressively in big data analytics because it is truly representative of popular opinion based on millions of people. Despite bringing new opportunities, big data encounters the challenges such as extremely large number of observations (e.g., millions of transactions), high dimensionality (e.g., thousands of items), and immediate response. Taking big data into consideration, the conventional association analysis is frustrated by the extraction of patterns information. Specifically, the computational complexity of frequent itemsets mining increases exponentially by the number of items, which has been proven to be an NP-Complete problem. Although many studies used a pruning-patterns strategy to reduce the complexity, it probably distorts the shape of data and incurs inaccurate result. In this paper, we introduce relative patterns discovery (named RPD) that explores the same patterns between each two observations. To show that RPD is a pragmatic solution toward big data analytics, we design a scalable outlier detection method (named SOD) based on the concept of RPD. Particularly, SOD can score the anomaly without enumerate all the relative patterns. The empirical investigations, conducted with various real-world datasets, demonstrate that SOD performs well even in the environment of large number of observations and high dimensionality."
w,"Recently, a new window to explore tweet data has been opened in TExVis tool through visualizing the relations between the frequent keywords. However, timeline exploration of tweet data, not present in TExVis, could play a critical factor in understanding the changes in people's feedback and reaction over time. Targeting this, we present our visual analytics tool, called TEVisE. It uses an enhanced adjacency matrix diagram to overcome the cluttering problem in TExVis and visualizes the evolution of frequent keywords and the relations between these keywords over time. We conducted two user studies to find answers of our two formulated research questions. In the first user study, we focused on evaluating the used visualization layouts in both tools from the perspectives of common usability metrics and cognitive load theory. We found better accuracy in our TEVisE tool for tasks related to reading exploring relations between frequent keywords. In the second study, we collected users' feedback towards exploring the summary view and the new timeline evolution view inside TEVisE. In the second study, we collected users' feedback towards exploring the summary view and the new timeline evolution view inside TEVisE. We found that participants preferred both view, one to get overall glance while the other to get the trends changes over time."
w,"This study focuses in urban spaces such as Manila Philippines where urban locations have experienced intense flooding which leads to loss or damage of properties, destruction of homes or suspension of classes. In this point, although flood risk cannot be totally eliminated, this research will be instrumental in flood forecasting as a key tool in flood warning which can provide adequate lead time for the public to play down flood casualties. The purpose of this research is to design an application that will provide flood hazard in the next 2 to 4 hours base from users selected locations and GPS locations, using the source data from PAGASA's hourly forecast, the system transforms the data into a notification warning via Android Application. A Rapid Application Development Prototyping was utilized by the researcher as a model during the development of the study. It used a total population purposive sampling in the evaluation performance of the system. Furthermore, the developed system was scored with a mean of 4.94 which exhibits that the respondents strongly agree with the capabilities of the developed system. It was then concluded that the developed system was able to supply Flood Hazard Analytics for Urban Spaces to guide the local government, and the Filipino people to spot possible flood behavior in a given location."
w,"Mobile phones, sensors, patients, hospitals, researchers, providers and organizations are nowadays generating huge amounts of healthcare data. The real challenge in healthcare systems is how to find, collect, analyze and manage information to make people's lives healthier and easier, by contributing not only to understand new diseases and therapies but also to predict outcomes at earlier stages and make real-time decisions. In this paper, we explain the potential benefits of big data to healthcare and explore how it improves treatment and empowers patients, providers and researchers. We also describe the ability of reality mining in collecting large amounts of data to understand people's habits, detect and predict outcomes, and illustrate the benefits of big data analytics through five effective new pathways that could be adopted to promote patients' health, enhance medicine, reduce cost and improve healthcare value and quality. We cover some big data solutions in healthcare and we shed light on implementations, such as Electronic Healthcare Record (HER) and Electronic Healthcare Predictive Analytics (e-HPA) in US hospitals. Furthermore, we complete the picture by highlighting some challenges that big data analytics faces in healthcare."
w,"In this work, we present an ongoing, three year project funded by the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA-E) to develop an infrastructure to accelerate the development and deployment of artificial intelligence solutions for the electric grid. The project addresses the critical issues that we have identified as hampering the deployment of AI on electric grid measurements. These issues have stymied the potential for insight from high resolution grid measurements and generally hindered artificial intelligence innovation in the utility industry. The project consists of three main components. The first is the deployment of a diverse set of grid sensors to capture a variety of grid behaviour, both from the field and in simulation. The second is the deployment of a highly performant, scalable, cloud-based data management and AI platform designed for time series data to enable the easy storage, processing and analysis of grid sensor data. The third is the cultivation of an open research community of experts around the platform and data through useful educational material, code and data sharing, and data science competitions. Overall, the project will accelerate the development of analytics, machine learning, and AI by addressing existing gaps in data, tools, and people, with the aim of improving the electric grid."
w,"Data Analytics and Machine Learning have become an integral part of everyone's daily life. Most software and intelligent systems use these technologies either to make predictions or to take informed actions. However, Machine Learning and Data Analytics are not easy to make use of for regular users, especially for people who do not belong to the Computer Science domain, as it requires a lot of coding knowledge and expertise in Mathematics. To avoid the steep learning curve, the implementation proposes using Analytics as a Service. Though this has been implemented before by industry stalwarts such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google, these services are still very complex to use. They are paid services and require prior Machine Learning knowledge. The Service is relatively easy to use, and requires no prior knowledge of Machine Learning or Data Analytics. The user has to upload a dataset and choose the variable that has to be predicted, the system builds a model and provide it as a ReST based API, which can be called from any device or software that is connected to the internet. This paper is mainly aimed at aiding students and staff in integrating Machine Learning based intelligence into their software and devices, and in performing Data Analytics."
w,"The use of biometrics such as fingerprints, voices, and images are becoming increasingly more ubiquitous through people's daily lives, in applications ranging from authentication, identification, to much more sophisticated analytics, thanks to the recent rapid advances in both the sensing hardware technologies and machine learning techniques. While providing improved user experiences and better business insights, the use of biometrics has raised serious privacy concerns, due to their intrinsic sensitive nature and the accompanying high risk of leaking personally identifiable and private information. In this paper, we propose a novel utility-preserving biometric anonymization framework, which provides a method to anonymize a biometric dataset without introducing artificial or external noise, with a process that retains features relevant for downstream machine learning-based analyses to extract interesting attributes that are valuable to relevant services, businesses, and research organizations. We carried out a thorough experimental evaluation using publicly available visual and vocal datasets. Results show that our proposed framework can achieve a high level of anonymization, while at the same time retain underlying data utility such that subsequent analyses on the anonymized biometric data could still be carried out to yield satisfactory accuracy."
w,"The success of live comedy depends on a performer's ability to work an audience. Ethnographic studies suggest that this involves the co-ordinated use of subtle social signals such as body orientation, gesture, gaze by both performers and audience members. Robots provide a unique opportunity to test the effects of these signals experimentally. Using a life-size humanoid robot, programmed to perform a standup comedy routine, we manipulated the robot's patterns of gesture and gaze and examined their effects on the real-time responses of a live audience. The strength and type of responses were captured using SHORETNA computer vision analytics. The results highlight the complex, reciprocal social dynamics of performer and audience behavior. People respond more positively when the robot looks at them, negatively when it looks away and performative gestures also contribute to different patterns of audience response. This demonstrates how the responses of individual audience members depend on the specific interaction they're having with the performer. This work provides insights into how to design more effective, more socially engaging forms of robot interaction that can be used in a variety of service contexts."
w,"Background: This study practices the priorities of the World Economic Forum, Global Social Mobility Pillars 10th for the inclusive institutions. Global logistics discussed with accessibility needs in theoretical frameworks of Global Social Mobility Index (rankings for 2020 Turkey 64th, and Poland 30th). It is stated with sociological, technological, and economical improvements in line with on the global agenda. Methods: This article provides a data research, which considers the economic effects of Covid-19 for adults (>= 18 years of age and employed with high digital literacy) during lockdown. Theory of main synthesis is targeting UN Development Goals and WEF's Social Mobility Index. It is developed based on international literature and it is defined with total 100 Turkish people opinions and connected individual's budget with the logistics services. Results: Digital technologies as an enabler of inclusive work are delivering the digital flow with Industry 4.0 by changing the way of logistic services function into another virtual transportation platform. In this paper, with the aim of identifying future directions, more than 100 surveys reviewed focusing on inclusive workplace options. Conclusion: Economies with greater social mobility provide more opportunities with the content of the accessible procedures which useful instrument for each procurement mode; operational, tactical, and strategic. It confirms the efficiency, effectiveness, and experiences of people with the digitalization technologies (SIoV, IoT, Blockchain, RPA, AI, Data Analytics, etc.) It is recommended that the levels explained in this study contribute to future studies by accessible supply chain with inclusive work procedures."
w,"Background: Health promotion interventions on social networking sites can communicate individually tailored content to a large audience. User-generated content helps to maximize engagement, but health promotion websites have had variable success in supporting user engagement. Objective: The aim of our study was to examine which elements of moderator and participant behavior stimulated and maintained interaction with a sexual health promotion site on Facebook. Methods: We examined the pattern and content of posts on a Facebook page. Google analytics was used to describe the number of people using the page and viewing patterns. A qualitative, thematic approach was used to analyze content. Results: During the study period (January 18, 2010, to June 27, 2010), 576 users interacted 888 times with the site through 508 posts and 380 comments with 93% of content generated by users. The user-generated conversation continued while new participants were driven to the site by advertising, but interaction with the site ceased rapidly after the advertising stopped. Conversations covered key issues on chlamydia and chlamydia testing. Users endorsed testing, celebrated their negative results, and modified and questioned key messages. There was variation in user approach to the site from sharing of personal experience and requesting help to joking about sexually transmitted infection. The moderator voice was reactive, unengaged, tolerant, simplistic, and was professional in tone. There was no change in the moderator approach throughout the period studied. Conclusions: Our findings suggest this health promotion site provided a space for single user posts but not a self-sustaining conversation. Possible explanations for this include little new content from the moderator, a definition of content too narrow to hold the interest of participants, and limited responsiveness to user needs. Implications for health promotion practice include the need to consider a life cycle approach to online community development for health promotion and the need for a developing moderator strategy to reflect this. This strategy should reflect two facets of moderation for online health promotion interventions: (1) unengaged and professional oversight to provide a safe space for discussion and to maintain information quality, and (2) a more engaged and interactive presence designed to maintain interest that generates new material for discussion and is responsive to user requests."
w,"Background: Finding Your Way is a culturally adapted shared decision making (SDM) resource for Aboriginal (First Nations) people of Australia. It integrates the Eight Ways of Aboriginal Learning (8 Ways) and was created by Aboriginal health workers and community members in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Objective: To explore the perceived acceptability, usability, and feasibility of Finding Your Way as a SDM resource for Aboriginal people making health and wellbeing decisions. Methods: The web-based resources were disseminated using social media, professional networks, publications, and the 'Koori grapevine'. Thirteen 'champions' also promoted the resources. An online questionnaire was available on the website for three months. Framework analysis determined early indications of its acceptability, usability, and feasibility. Web and social media analytics were also analysed. Partnership with and leadership by Aboriginal people was integrated at all phases of the project. Results: The main landing page was accessed 5219 times by 4259 users. 132 users completed the questionnaire. The non-linear and visual aspects of the resources 'speak to mob' and identified with Aboriginal culture. The inclusion of social and emotional well-being, and the holistic approach were well received by the small number of users who opted to provide feedback. They suggested that non-digital formats and guidance on the resources are required to support use in clinical practice. Conclusion: The 8 Ways enabled the development of a culturally safe SDM resource for Aboriginal people, which was well received by users who took the time to provide feedback after a brief dissemination process. Additional accessible formats, practice guides and training are required to support uptake in clinical practice. Practice implications: Finding Your Way could be used to help improve experiences, health literacy, decision making quality and outcomes of healthcare for Aboriginal Australians."
w,"Visualization is an inherently interdisciplinary research area: visualization researchers are always visualizing other people's data. While recent trends in the field has turned toward a more inclusive audience, particularly within the topic of visualization for the masses, the traditional user group for our tools have been the domain expert: people who are experts in a specific professional domain where they want to apply visualization and analytics, but who often lack high literacy, training, and motivation in visualization and visual analytics. Such domain experts want to opportunistically reap the benefits of visualization, but have no patience for long training, poor interaction or visual design, or complex displays. While domain experts are a familiar user group, surprisingly little effort has been devoted towards characterizing them for both design and evaluation purposes. To help the visualization community better understand this specific group, in this paper, we describe the characteristics of domain experts, discuss existing examples designed for them, and propose possible guidelines to facilitate the design process. We believe this discussion will help visualization researchers better understand this group and uncover more research opportunities."
w,"Background: The OneTouch Verio Flex (R) (OTVF) blood glucose (BG) meter features a ColorSure (R) Range Indicator. Diabetes management is enhanced by connecting the meter to the OneTouch Reveal (R) (OTR) mobile app. We sought to provide real-world evidence (RWE) that combining both devices improves glycemic control. Methods: Anonymized glucose and app analytics were extracted from a server from over 144 000 people with diabetes (PWDs). Data from their first 14 days using OTVF and OTR were compared with 14 days prior to 90- and 180-day timepoints using paired within-subject differences. Results: In people with type 1 diabetes (PwT1D) or people with type 2 diabetes (PwT2D), readings in-range (RIR) improved by +6.1 (54.5% to 60.6%) and +11.9 percentage points (68.2% to 80.1%), respectively, over 180 days, and hyperglycemia was reduced by -6.6 (40.5% to 33.9%) and -12.0 (30.3% to 18.3%). In total, 35% of PwT1D and 40% of PwT2D improved RIR by >10 percentage points. People with type 1 diabetes spending two to four sessions or 10 to 20 minutes per week on the app improved RIR by +5.1 and 7.0, respectively. People with type 2 diabetes spending two to four sessions or 10 to 20 minutes per week on the app improved RIR by +11.6 and 12.0, respectively. In PwT1D or PwT2D, mean BG reduced by -11.4 and -19.5 mg/dL, respectively, from baseline to 180 days, with no clinically meaningful changes in percentage of hypoglycemic readings. All glycemic changes were statistically significant (P < .0005 level). Conclusion: Real-world data from over 144 000 PWDs demonstrated improved percentage readings in-range and reduced hyperglycemia in PWDs using the OneTouch Verio Flex blood glucose meter and OneTouch Reveal app."
w,"In the era of fake news, arguing has become all the more relevant, because, with the support of digital technologies, it is possible to set up powerful scenarios to confuse people, denigrate, insult, exclude, especially in environments of political and ideological dispute (Pacchioni, 2018). Digital analytics, one of the last most incisive digital leaps (Gerrish & Scott, 2018), capable of combining underlying behavioral patterns in depths that go into the unconscious and thereby influence the unconscious (Schneider, 2019), allows for the manipulation of referenda, elections, public opinion, political campaigns, sending messages ingeniously targeted to precisely reach the victims (Russell, 2019). This obscure capacity, made easier by the access to big data, is present in surveillance technologies that have rapidly evolved to combat terrorism (especially after the 9/11 event), becoming more terrorist than terrorism tactics! (Zuboff, 2019. Means, 2018). There is an intention in technologies to penetrate people's minds, not directly (it is impossible, at least for now), but via recurring patterns of thinking, to the point where it is possible to present what they want to hear, which, among other things, makes ads all the more fatal (Wu, 2016)."
w,"We are entering an era in which online personalities and personas will grow faster and faster. People are tending to use the Internet, and social media especially, more frequently and for a wider variety of purposes. In parallel, a number of cultural spaces have already decided to invest in marketing and message spreading through the web and the media. Growing their audience, or locating the appropriate group of people to share their information, remains a tedious task within the chaotic environment of the Internet. The investment is mainly financial-usually large-and directed to advertisements. Still, there is much space for research and investment in analytics that can provide evidence considering the spreading of the word and finding groups of people interested in specific information or trending topics and influencers. In this paper, we present a part of a national project that aims to perform an analysis of Twitter's trending topics. The main scope of the analysis is to provide a basic ordering on the topics based on their importance. Based on this, we clarify how cultural institutions can benefit from such an analysis in order to empower their online presence."
w,"PurposeThe main purpose of this paper is to analyse the current literature situation in terms of relationships between Industry 4.0 and quality management and TQM. The author wanted to understand what topics and issues can be considered the most relevant referring to the so-called Quality 4.0, what the literature is missing opening avenues for further research.Design/methodology/approachThis research employed a systematic literature review. In total, 75 papers from different sources were reviewed using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.FindingsFour categories of topics emerged, namely: creating value within the company through quality (big) data, analytics and artificial intelligence; developing Quality 4.0 skills and culture for quality people; customer value co-creation; cyber-physical systems and ERP for quality assurance and control. This paper also tried to understand if there is a definition of Quality 4.0 based on determined methods.Research limitations/implicationsSystematic literature review could have introduced some limitations in terms of the number and reliability of reviewed papers. Probably some interesting papers had been not intentionally missed.Practical implicationsConsultants and managers in developing and implementing their own Quality 4.0 models could use many practical and discussed implications concerning I4.0 technologies and quality management.Originality/valueThis is one of the first papers which employed the systematic literature review for researching Industry 4.0, quality management and TQM relationships."
w,"Sentiment is an important feature of natural language. It is used to understand semantic of texts and opinion of people. There are many practical applications, which require to extract sentiment from texts: advertising analytics, interactive chat bots, opinion mining Today, different supervised techniques are used to extract sentiment from texts which require large manually labeled datasets that are expensive and time consuming to build. Moreover, such datasets should cover vocabularies and patterns of use of different contexts. Additionally, the efficiency of supervised methods trained on a well-written texts can dramatically decrease on users' texts from social media due to typos, slang, short length of sentences. To solve these problems and to reduce human involvement, we propose semi-supervised sentiment analysis method based on topic modeling with Additive Regularization. To evaluate the efficiency of this method we applied it to several open-source datasets for which sentiment labels are available. The study shows promising results in terms of f1-score with minimal human involvement. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

w,"This article explores the unique contribution that Foucault's work on genealogy and governmentality can make to the analysis of contemporary programs of government. The article uses an Australian study of the 'problem' of chronic illness to argue that this perspective offers valuable insights into how 'problems' such as chronic illness have become linked to advanced liberal discourses and practices of self-governing and self-responsibility. These insights are particularly valuable in fields such as primary health care that have a noted shortage of critical and reflective studies that explore the links between people and changing ideas of health and disease. This article details how taking up an analytics of governmentality and political genealogy informed by Foucault, facilitated the tracing of the dominant discourses and practices, and the connections to the day-to -day lives of the clients with chronic diseases. Importantly, this approach opened up a more critical consideration of the ways in which dispersed approaches to governing through programs, such as integrated care, shape and influence the lives of individuals. These dispersed ways of governing are not linear but rather unfold through ongoing relays, connections and the (re)production of discourses."
w,"Among the numerous implications of digitalization, the debate about 'big data' has gained momentum. The central idea capturing attention is that digital data represents the newest key asset organizations should use to gain a competitive edge. Data can be sold, matched with other data, mined, and used to make inferences about anything, from people's behavior to weather conditions. Particularly, what is known as 'big data analytics' -i.e. the modeling and analysis of big data-has become the capability which differentiates, from the rest of the market, the most successful companies. An entire business ecosystem has emerged around the digital data asset, and new types of companies, such as analytical competitors and analytical deputies, are proliferating as a result of the analysis of digital data. However, virtually absent from the big data debate is any mention of one of its constitutive mechanisms-that is, dataveillance. Dataveillance-which refers to the systematic monitoring of people or groups, by means of personal data systems in order to regulate or govern their behavior-sets the stage and reinforces the development of the data economy celebrated in the big data debate. This article aims to make visible the interdependence between dataveillance, big data and analytics by providing real examples of how companies collect, process, analyze and use data to achieve their business objectives."
w,"The Internet of Things confers seamless connectivity between people and objects, and its confluence with the Cloud improves our lives. Predictive analytics in the medical domain can help turn a reactive healthcare strategy into a proactive one, with advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches permeating the healthcare industry. As the subfield of ML, deep learning possesses the transformative potential for accurately analysing vast data at exceptional speeds, eliciting intelligent insights, and efficiently solving intricate issues. The accurate and timely prediction of diseases is crucial in ensuring preventive care alongside early intervention for people at risk. With the widespread adoption of electronic clinical records, creating prediction models with enhanced accuracy is key to harnessing recurrent neural network variants of deep learning possessing the ability to manage sequential time-series data. The proposed system acquires data from IoT devices, and the electronic clinical data stored on the cloud pertaining to patient history are subjected to predictive analytics. The smart healthcare system for monitoring and accurately predicting heart disease risk built around Bi-LSTM (bidirectional long short-term memory) showcases an accuracy of 98.86%, a precision of 98.9%, a sensitivity of 98.8%, a specificity of 98.89%, and an F-measure of 98.86%, which are much better than the existing smart heart disease prediction systems."
w,"In this study, the phenomenon of professional ethnocentrism has been tried to be conceptualized. In this direction, a research has been designed on what professional ethnocentrism is, what its indicators are, what its causes and reflections are, and what should be done to reduce it. The study group consisted of 29 people from different health professional groups. In-depth interviews were conducted with the participants about the phenomenon through semi -structured forms and phenomenology was preferred from qualitative research designs. During the analysis of the data, the MAXQDA 18 Pro Analytics Program was used. As a result of the research, it is seen that people have an ethnocentric tendency towards other professions due to the fact that they see their own professional group or the field in which they specialize in a central position. In this context, it has been determined that the phenomenon of professional ethnocentrism evokes a negative situation in the mind and is common among health professional groups. In this sense, it was concluded that professional ethnocentrism has indicators such as negative attitudes and behaviors, change in communication style, and its causes can be addressed at personal, familial, organizational, professional and macro levels. As a result of occupational ethnocentrism, the individual, professional, organization and health system may be damaged."
w,"In the development of the nation agriculture plays a significant role. IoT technology helps gather knowledge about environments such as wind, precipitation, temperature, and soil fertility. IoT allows farmers to get connected to their farm from anywhere at any time. Difficulty regarding agriculture has been always hampered; slow down the development of the country. These patterns benefit people in many respects, such as analysis using IoT and artificial intelligence, data sharing, and analytics in an unparalleled way. In this paper, we review IoT implementation in monitoring the environmental conditions of the crops and farms in various agriculture sectors. Additional IoT monitoring, control, and optimization functionality may be used to remotely monitor the control systems or actuators attached to the microcontrollers to ensure that the crop can react promptly as required. In this article, today's climatic change scenario aims to establish a comprehensive vision of IoT implementation in the farming sector to improve agricultural production in the future, as well as to guarantee the constant supplier of food. We describe the advantages of applying IoT on livestock, weather surveillance, the agricultural warehouse, and the intelligent irrigation technique."
w,"The analytics function is growing in importance as the digitisation of business operations and markets leads to the generation of ever-increasing amounts of data. Analysing this data in a manner aligned with company priorities and structures can generate value through supporting effective decision-making, rapid product innovation, supply chain visibility and other aspects of intra- and inter-company operations. To guide the growth we derive a novel maturity framework focused on driving the Analytics-Business alignment, covering a number of diverse organisational facets such as data, leadership support, processes, data management, governance, technology and people. It differentiates itself by using a firm theoretical foundation and providing guidance for analytics capability development instead of simply diagnosing the existing maturity level. To guide development, it distinguishes between two aspects of maturity - a state aspect, which is used to assess the present situation in an organisation, and a management aspect, which evaluates management attitude in order to establish the next stage of analytics growth. The framework has been implemented in a web-based tool and its utility has been demonstrated by obtaining feedback from 64 managers from a variety of sectors, who have praised its ability to integrate diagnosis of the current situation with guidance on the next steps necessary to develop analytics maturity."
w,"Developing a vaccine supply chain (VSC) is an intricate process due to product perishability issues and crossborder supply complexities. On top of that, developing a pandemic-driven VSC is more challenging due to having significant operational, infrastructural, and policy-related disruptions. From the perspective of a developing economy such as Bangladesh, handling the global COVID-19 pandemic through the proper establishment of a VSC has been disrupted by a multitude of organizational, economic, and policy barriers. This has hindered the process of establishing a resilient VSC let alone ensuring the sustainability of the supply chain (SC). Therefore, this study strives to identify the key VSC strategies and their interrelationships under four groups: Intra-organizational, Inter-organizational, Legislative, and Environmental, based on previous literature and the expert opinions of industrial practitioners and policymakers. 20 strategies are ranked, and their causal relationships are discussed using the fuzzy DEMATEL method. This study utilizes the fuzzy set theory to deal with the vagueness of human beings' perceptions, and the DEMATEL method to form a structural model to find out the cause (influencing and independent) and effect (influenced and dependent) relationships among different strategies. The outcome of this study shows that 'developing local production facilities for vaccines', 'creating extensive governmental policy to ensure efficient distribution of vaccines', 'ensuring sustainable investment in vaccine manufacturing and distribution', 'integrating advanced data analytics for robust and resilient demand prediction' and 'promoting public-private-people partnership for sustainable investment' are the most prominent strategies. The findings provide stakeholders and policymakers with a practical framework for developing a sustainable VSC prepared for any virus outbreak, such as COVID-19, while also achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."
w,"This article presents a detailed analysis with an emphasis on actual data to illustrate the value of learning analytics in boosting the retention and graduation of college and university students. The review covers a range of relevant topics, including: To fulfil the competency-building requirements of the future, educational institutions like universities and colleges will need to develop innovative teaching methods. This qualitative case study makes an attempt to establish what skills and knowledge will be necessary for college students to acquire in the future, as well as how learning analytics may aid facilitate the acquisition of these skills and information. Because future abilities are formed on the trifecta of subject development, objects, and the social environment, it makes sense to focus on all three of these aspects simultaneously. The results of a qualitative content analysis of group interviews conducted with 19 educators are the primary focus of this article. According to the findings, crucial components for future subject development include reflective competence, self-awareness and self-management, learning literacy, personal agency and self-efficacy, and learning literacy. Learning analytics have the ability to enhance individuals' development since they give people with the tools to reflect on their own learning and competence growth and to become more self-aware of both their strengths and flaws. Learning analytics were also thought to encourage learning via active engagement, self-assurance in one's own capacity to learn, knowledge of one's own learning processes, and metacognition. Students need to acquire object-related abilities such as flexibility and digital competence in order to be able to handle complex subjects and assignments."
w,"Critical infrastructure systems which are interrelated with people's daily life perform functions in multiple domains. However, with the explosion of specialized textual information in such systems, providing discriminative services for users through potential knowledge discovery becomes an essential and technical concern. Once massive data analytics is conducted in standalone server, the performance will degenerate tremendously. Alternatively, people cannot conveniently get such discriminative (self-caring) services. To address these concerns, we propose the general solution of EDAWS: a Novel Distributed Framework with Efficient Data Analytics Workspace towards Discriminative Service for Critical Infrastructures, through leveraging the state-of-the-art software technologies and computing paradigms. We argue it from the following aspects: Firstly, the server-side platform facilitates native data capture, storage, index and data mining with a systematic organization. Secondly, a text-mining approach with index building in parallel is conducted for various functional business, by exploiting the potential of Lucene-based distributed cluster. Thirdly, with the widespread usage of tiny but powerful mobile devices, the server-side platform could be accessed by mobile-side clients remotely in a more convenient way. To demonstrate our solution, a case study of smart residence prototype towards discriminative services in terms of information retrieval, personalized information push, and hot topic discovery is thoroughly discussed. The extensively experimental studies are conducted for the prototype over various real-world datasets. Experimental results indicate that, data processing which runs on computing nodes has good scalability with data sizes and computing nodes, and the prototype passes from data to discriminative services successfully.

w,"In the era of information technology and big data, the extraction, commodification, and control of personal information is redefining how people relate and interact. However, the challenges that big data collection and analytics can introduce in trust-based societies, like those of Scandinavia, are not yet understood. For instance, in the energy sector, data generated through smart appliances, like smart metering devices, can have collateral implications for the end-users. In this paper, we present a systematic review of scientific articles indexed in Scopus to identify possible relationships between the practices of collecting, processing, analysing, and using people's data and people's responses to such practices. We contextualise this by looking at research about Scandinavian societies and link this to the academic literature on big data and trust, big data and smart meters, data ethics and the energy sector, surveillance capitalism, and subsequently performing a reflexive thematic analysis. We broadly situate our understanding of culture in this context on the interactions between cognitive norms, material culture, and energy practices. Our analysis identified a number of articles discussing problems and solutions to do with the practices of surveillance capitalism. We also found that research addresses these challenges in different ways. While some research focuses on technological amendments to address users' privacy protection, only few examine the fundamental ethical questions that discuss how big data practices may change societies and increase their vulnerability. The literature suggests that even in highly trusting societies, like the ones found in Scandinavian countries, trust can be undermined and weakened."
w,"Imagine a transportation system in which passengers simply get on/off without any explicit ticketing operation. Yet, the system tracks usage and charges passengers. Such a system will not only be more convenient and efficient, but also be more conducive for analytics, than existing systems. Towards that goal, we exploit the opportunity that people are carrying sensor-equipped smart devices, and their motion trajectories/patterns and experienced environment can be measured continuously. Assuming that vehicles are also equipped with such sensors (perhaps fixed devices or smart devices carried by drivers), the vehicles' motion and the experienced environment characteristics can also be recorded and uploaded to cloud. Under these assumptions, we hypothesize that the motion/environment sensed by a passenger's smart device correlates strongly with that of the vehicle she is traveling in and is distinct from that of other vehicles and/or other traces of the same vehicle. In this paper, we expand on this intuition and develop a system, called RideSense, that matches a passenger's sensor trace against the traces of buses in that area, to determine which bus, when she has taken and where she gets on/off. Our evaluation of RideSense, with 20+ hours of traces from 5 bus lines in our area, shows that it achieves an accuracy of 84 similar to 98%, depending on the choice of sensors and their features, positions of the passengers' phones and the metrics of measurement. These results, while far from conclusive, offer confidence that ticketless public transportation may indeed be a possibility in smart cities of the future."
w,"While evidence suggests that adults with serious mental illness have an elevated rate of 30-day readmissions after medical hospitalizations, most studies are of patients who are privately insured or Medicare beneficiaries, and little is known about the differential experiences of people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. We used the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan (R) Medicaid Multi-State Database to study 43,817 Medicaid enrollees from 11 states, age 18-64, who were discharged from medical hospitalizations in 2011. Our outcome was unplanned all-cause readmissions within 30 days of discharge. In a multivariable analysis, compared to those with no SMI, people with schizophrenia had the highest odds of 30-day readmission (aOR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.33-1.59), followed by those with bipolar disorder (aOR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.14-1.38), and those with major depressive disorder (aOR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.06-1.30). Readmissions also were more likely among those with substance use disorders, males, those with Medicaid eligibility due to disability, patients with longer index hospitalizations, and those with 2 or more medical co-morbidities. This is the first large-scale study to demonstrate the elevated risk of hospital readmission among low-income, working-age adults with schizophrenia. Given their greater psychological, social, and economic vulnerability, our findings can be used to design transition interventions and service delivery systems that address their complex needs."
w,"Purpose This paper aims to contribute to the literature on human resources (HR) digitalization, specifically on HR analytics, disentangling the concept of analytics applied to HR and explaining the factors that hinder companies from moving to analytics. Therefore, the central research questions addressed in this study are: what does HR analytics encompass? What impedes the adoption of analytics in HR within organizations? Design/methodology/approach The authors performed a comprehensive literature review on analytics as applied in HR. The authors relied on two of the major multidisciplinary publication databases (i.e. Scopus and WoS). A total of 64 manuscripts from 2010 to 2019 were content analyzed. Findings The results reveal that there is an ongoing confusion on HR analytics conceptualization. Yet, it seems that there is an emerging consensus on what HR analytics encompasses. The authors have identified 14 different barriers for HR analytics adoption grouped into four categories, namely, data and models, software and technology, people and management. Grounding on them the authors propose a set of 14 key factors to help to successfully adopt HR Analytics in companies. Originality/value This paper brings clarity over the conceptualization of HR analytics by offering a comprehensive definition. Additionally, it facilitates business and HR leaders in making informed decisions on adopting and implementing HR analytics. Moreover, it assists HR researchers in positioning their paper more explicitly in current debates and encouraging them to develop some future avenues of research departing from some questions posed."
w,"There is a compelling and pressing need to better understand the temporal dynamics of public sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccines in the US on a national and state-wise level for facilitating appropriate public policy applications. Our analysis of social media data from early February and late March 2021 shows that, despite the overall strength of positive sentiment and despite the increasing numbers of Americans being fully vaccinated, negative sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccines still persists among segments of people who are hesitant towards the vaccine. In this study, we perform sentiment analytics on vaccine tweets, monitor changes in public sentiment over time, contrast vaccination sentiment scores with actual vaccination data from the US CDC and the Household Pulse Survey (HPS), explore the influence of maturity of Twitter user-accounts and generate geographic mapping of tweet sentiments. We observe that fear sentiment remained unchanged in populous states, whereas trust sentiment declined slightly in these same states. Changes in sentiments were more notable among less populous states in the central sections of the US. Furthermore, we leverage the emotion polarity based Public Sentiment Scenarios (PSS) framework, which was developed for COVID-19 sentiment analytics, to systematically posit implications for public policy processes with the aim of improving the positioning, messaging, and administration of vaccines. These insights are expected to contribute to policies that can expedite the vaccination program and move the nation closer to the cherished herd immunity goal."
w,"The Internet of Things (IoT), which provides seamless connectivity between people and things, improves our quality of life. In the medical field, predictive analytics can help transform a reactive healthcare (HC) strategy into a proactive one. The HC industry embraces cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) technologies. ML's area of deep learning has the revolutionary potential to reliably analyze massive volumes of data quickly, produce insightful revelations and solve challenging issues. This article proposes an energy-aware heart disease prediction (HDP) system based on enhanced spider monkey optimization (ESMO) and a weight-optimized neural network for an IoT-based HC environment. The proposed work consists of two essential phases: energy-efficient data transmission and HDP. In energy-efficient transmission, the cluster leaders are optimally selected using ESMO and the cluster formation is done based on Euclidean distance. In HDP, the patient data are collected from the dataset, and essential features are extracted. After that, the dimensionality reduction is carried out using the modified linear discriminant analysis approach to reduce over-fitting issues. Finally, the HDP uses the enhanced Archimedes weight-optimized deep neural network (EAWO-DNN). The simulation findings demonstrate that the proposed optimal clustering mechanism enhances the network's lifespan by consuming minimal energy compared to the existing techniques. Also, the proposed EAWO-DNN classifier achieves higher prediction accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure than the conventional methods for predicting heart disease in IoT.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

w,"The need for smart e-learning environments is resulting in new challenges for researchers and practitioners to develop intelligent systems that can be used to automate the Higher Education (HE) activities in an intelligent way. Some common examples of such activities are analyzing, finding, and ranking the right resource to teach a course, analyzing and finding the people with common research interests to start joint research projects, and using data analytics and machine reasoning techniques for conducting the exams with different levels of complexities. Ontological reasoning and smart data analytics can play an important role in analyzing and automating these HE activities and processes. In this paper, we present a framework named as Higher Education Activities and Processes Automation Framework (HEAPAF). The HEAPAF framework can be used to identify, extract, process, and produce the semantically enriched data in machine understandable format from different educational resources. We also present the Higher Education Ontology (HEO) that we designed and developed to accommodate the HE data and then to perform analysis and reasoning on it. As a proof of concept, we present a case study on the topic, analyzing, finding, and ranking the right resources to teach a course, which can dramatically improve the learning patterns of students in the growing smart educational environment. Finally, we provide the evaluation of our framework as evidence of its competency and consistency in improving academic analytics for educational activities and processes by using machine reasoning."
w,"With the increase in the dependency of our life on technology and data, smart spaces have become integral in providing an environment for data collection, analysis, and machine responses. This paper discusses the current research in this field and the challenges that arise in the execution of these smart spaces. We address the major challenges of hardware design, data analysis, and energy efficiency in a new data aware smart environment that collects time-stamped data for position, movement, temperature, and vibration sensors. Data collected from these sensors is used to achieve energy efficiency, for real time localization in conjunction with machine learning mechanisms to analyze human activities. We evaluate six different machine learning algorithms for human activity detection task, on a data set collected in our laboratory. Results show high classification performance for all methods giving up to 99.95% classification accuracy. We also implemented energy-efficiency measures, leading to up to 30% energy efficiency improvement on top of our initial design. This ambient environment, along with data analytics and improved energy efficiency, provides information regarding the occupancy and behavior of people within its range. Spaces such as conference rooms, common areas such as libraries, classrooms, and even public spaces such as public transport can benefit from our design. Our system avoids privacy issues by using no audio/visual devices. This system thus provides an insight into smart spaces, their current trends, and what future direction research such as ours would lead them to."
w,"Billions are faced with poor sanitation in developing countries, forcing United Nations' to miss sanitation targets over the years. This is mainly due to the poor condition of sanitation in the global-south comprising mostly developing countries. International and national organizations are mainly focused on building sanitation infrastructure to target the Sustainable Development Goal 6.2 (i.e., eradicating open defecation by 2030). But the service delivery in terms of monitoring & maintenance along with other governance issues is often overlooked in most cases. How can we arrange sustainable monitoring of a global sanitation community? In this paper, we discuss how information and communications technology (ICT) may be used to address sanitation governance. We outline the necessary governance criteria found in our field-observations and then explore ICT options to address these issues. We conceptualized and created 'Find A Loo' - a mobile application designed to be a 'good-governance' enabler. We tested this application with the help of System Usability Scale (SUS) and Potential Capability Scale (PCS), where it appeared as 'Good' with an 'A Grade' score, based on evaluators' satisfaction on usability and capability. Overall the evaluation affirms that the application is not only useful and ready to use, but also capable of helping in addressing governance issues in sanitation. This work will be of interest to policy & decision-makers, researchers, service providers, NGOs and people working in the sanitation space. Further, such a system lends itself to analytics that helps optimize the performance of sanitation infrastructure."
w,"Automated high-throughput phenotyping with sensors, imaging, and other on-farm technologies has resulted in a flood of data that are largely under-utilized. Drastic cost reductions in sequencing and other omics technology have also facilitated the ability for deep phenotyping of livestock at the molecular level. These advances have brought the animal sciences to a cross-roads in data science where increased training is needed to manage, record, and analyze data to generate knowledge and advances in Agriscience related disciplines. This paper describes the opportunities and challenges in using high-throughput phenotyping, big data, analytics, and related technologies in the livestock industry based on discussions at the Livestock High-Throughput Phenotyping and Big Data Analytics meeting, held in November 2017 (see: https://www.animalgenome.org/bioinfo/community/workshops/2017/). Critical needs for investments in infrastructure for people (e.g., big data training), data (e.g., data transfer, management, and analytics), and technology (e.g., development of low cost sensors) were defined by this group. Though some subgroups of animal science have extensive experience in predictive modeling, cross-training in computer science, statistics, and related disciplines are needed to use big data for diverse applications in the field. Extensive opportunities exist for public and private entities to harness big data to develop valuable research knowledge and products to the benefit of society under the increased demands for food in a rapidly growing population."
w,"The term 'big data' is used to describe data that are beyond the capabilities of an organization to store, analyze and use for accurate and timely decision making. They have alternately been described in terms of characteristics of volume, velocity, variety, veracity. We propose another characteristic of volatility for big data that should be considered in their use for decision making. We utilize a case study approach with a mid-sized company in the hospitality industry to elucidate challenges that an organization faces in developing a big data strategy and highlight research needed in this domain. Challenges identified were technical (inconsistent and unstandardized data, implementation and use of new analytics platforms, obtaining a global view of data, visualization of data, integrating mobile data), organizational (finding people with the right skills, users' desire for customization), and strategic management (finding return on investment in big data, alignment of business and analytics strategies, leadership of analytics initiatives and thought). Decision questions to be addressed in using big data for a marketing decision are illustrated. We demonstrate the use of the decision framework and illustrate challenges identified in the case study with sentiment analysis of Twitter data."
w,"Sustainable urban freight transport is a key element of the smart city concept. In this context, the availability of large number of citizens connected with mobile devices has created numerous opportunities for performing the last mile delivery (LMD) in more environmentally friendly forms. However, due to several logistical challenges, the assignment of delivery jobs to the crowd is a complex and multifaceted process. Motivated by the research gap for development of practical crowdshipping methods, this study proposes an integrated framework for the assignment of LMD to a set of registered crowdshippers. In contrast to the dominant crowdshipping model in which individuals perform dedicated delivery trips, the framework proposed in this research employs people going about their daily travels. The proposed framework is composed of two components: (i) trajectory analytics for profiling the crowd to identify the list of suitable crowdshippers and (ii) the optimisation module that aims at maximising platform's profitability. We validated the framework using real-world crowdshipping operations data, which allows us to employ the mobility patterns extracted from geo-location data of mobile devices. The experimental results demonstrated satisfactory performance in terms of profit maximisation, computational time and environmental performance."
w,"Visual surveillance systems use more and more cameras in order to cover wider areas and reduce blind spots. Cameras placement and configuration usually depends on the area to be monitored and the size of objects in the scene. Video analytics systems also require a minimal size to get detailed features of objects or people. Most vision-based surveillance systems focus on detection and tracking of people or objects in the scene. However, it is often more meaningful to describe people with high-level information such as hair style, carrying bag or other attributes. In order to perform this detection a close view is required. In this paper, a collaborative camera pair system tackles this problem and retrieves detailed features in a wide scene following the master-slave approach. A PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) camera is defined as slave and zooms on the targets detected by the master camera with wide coverage. We introduce an automatic method to estimate the internal camera parameters in order to have an efficient control of the camera pair combined with a novel real-time bag detection algorithm. Targets are first identified in the master camera and the slave camera will zoom in to the targets to detect different types of bags. Experimental results will be shown on real-data at each step of the approach."
w,"The expanding integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in various aspects of society makes the infosphere around us increasingly complex. Humanity already faces many obstacles trying to have a better understanding of our own minds, but now we have to continue finding ways to make sense of the minds of AI. The issue of AI's capability to have independent thinking is of special attention. When dealing with such an unfamiliar concept, people may rely on existing human properties, such as survival desire, to make assessments. Employing information-processing-based Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) analytics on a dataset of 266 residents in the United States, we found that the more people believe that an AI agent seeks continued functioning, the more they believe in that AI agent's capability of having a mind of its own. Moreover, we also found that the above association becomes stronger if a person is more familiar with personally interacting with AI. This suggests a directional pattern of value reinforcement in perceptions of AI. As the information processing of AI becomes even more sophisticated in the future, it will be much harder to set clear boundaries about what it means to have an autonomous mind."
w,"Background: To reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the associated spread of COVID-19, many jurisdictions around the world imposed mandatory or recommended social or physical distancing. As a result, at the beginning of the pandemic, various communication materials appeared online to promote distancing. Explanations of the science underlying these mandates or recommendations were either highly technical or highly simplified. Objective: This study aimed to understand the effects of a dynamic visualization on distancing. Our overall aim was to help people understand the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in their community and the implications of their own behavior for themselves, those around them, the health care system, and society. Methods: Using Scrum, which is an agile framework; JavaScript (Vue.js framework); and code already developed for risk communication in another context of infectious disease transmission, we rapidly developed a new personalized web application. In our application, people make avatars that represent themselves and the people around them. These avatars are integrated into a 3-minute animation illustrating an epidemiological model for COVID-19 transmission, showing the differences in transmission with and without distancing. During the animation, the narration explains the science of how distancing reduces the transmission of COVID-19 in plain language in English or French. The application offers full captions to complement the narration and a descriptive transcript for people using screen readers. We used Google Analytics to collect standard usage statistics. A brief, anonymous, optional survey also collected self-reported distancing behaviors and intentions in the previous and coming weeks, respectively. We launched and disseminated the application on Twitter and Facebook on April 8, 2020, and April 9, 2020. Results: After 26 days, the application received 3588 unique hits from 82 countries. The optional survey at the end of the application collected 182 responses. Among this small subsample of users, survey respondents were nearly (170/177, 96%) already practicing distancing and indicated that they intended to practice distancing in the coming week (172/177, 97.2%). Among the small minority of people (n=7) who indicated that they had not been previously practicing distancing, 2 (29%) reported that they would practice distancing in the week to come. Conclusions: We developed a web application to help people understand the relationship between individual-level behavior and population-level effects in the context of an infectious disease spread. This study also demonstrates how agile development can be used to quickly create personalized risk messages for public health issues like a pandemic. The nonrandomized design of this rapid study prevents us from concluding the application's effectiveness; however, results thus far suggest that avatar-based visualizations may help people understand their role in infectious disease transmission."
w,"Knowledge management (KM) is no longer the new kid on the block. The term has been in use for over 30 years, it has been an established field of study for over 25, and this is the 21st ECKM. But how much has KM changed in that time? This paper considers that question by briefly comparing articles dated 1999 in the Web of Science database with those in 2019, and then looking in depth at practical case studies of KM published in 2019 according to that same database. It is common knowledge that the technology available has improved vastly during KM's history, but how has this impacted on other aspects of KM? Major themes from the earliest days of KM, such as repositories and communities of practice, are still highly visible in the literature. The approach taken in this paper is to use a people-processes-technology framework, separate the business processes from the knowledge processes that support them, and examine the linkages between the three elements of the people-processes-technology framework for both types of process. Current research shows processes to be the most studied of the three elements, especially the link whereby people help to design and then operate processes. The technological advances that have had most effect on KM are in technologies for general application. This is in contrast to the focus of technology research in KM in the 1990s, which had been on specific technologies for KM. Whether the latest technologies for artificial intelligence and analytics are general or specific to KM is a moot point, and probably depends on the background of the person you ask. The weakest current linkages are clearly those in which people should be helping to design the technology in use. Analytics developments in particular are as likely to be inflicted on the users/customers as to be designed by them. Artificial intelligence developments for KM in 2019 do not even include practical case studies, which is worrying."
w,"The idea of God is one of the most pervasive in human culture. It used to be considered mostly in metaphysical and ethical discussions, it has become a part of the discourse in the philosophy of technology. The metaphor of God is used by some authors to represent the role of artificial intelligence in the modern world. This paper explores four aspects of the metaphor: creation, omniscience, mystery, theodicy. The creative act shows the resemblance of humans to God, also in the sense that technology created by humans can get out of the control of the creator. The ability of AI to use data flows for analytics and prediction is considered as omniscience which looks mysterious due to the inability of people to intellectually grasp the work of AI. The discussion about building ethics into AI technology shows a desire to add to add one more feature to omniscient and omnipotent, namely benevolent. The metaphor of God as applied to AI reveals human fears and aspirations both in rational-pragmatic and symbolic terms. The metaphor of God exposes notions of transcendence in modern perceptions of technology. Also it continues the discussion about what should be the technological design of AI. Whether as co-worker or as communicator it is already putting us on a path towards thinking of a subject that is constituted in a superior way."
w,"Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is one of the major challenge of NLP (natural language processing).Business Analytics plays a key role in the current scenario with a perception that people wants to enhance their enterprise. In particular, these people rely on feedback of their goods to withstand the competition and knowledge mining that can give them an outstanding view into what to expect in the future. Few words or phrases may decide results or outcomes. As a majority of these people seek to boost their company in order to achieve full benefit by providing premium goods. In this aspect, sentiment analysis has gained a lot of interest in the current years. SA is an area of research of NLP that is used to classify a specific feature 's opinion or perspective within a text. This paper is based on the different methods used to identify a particular text according to the opinions conveyed by the user's i.e. whether the overall sentiment of a individual is negative or positive or neutral. We are also looking at the two advance approaches adopted (feature classification pursued by polarity classification) along with the experimental results. Finally in this paper we compared 3 ML classification techniques 1) Logistic Regression,2) Hybid Bag-Boost algorithm 3) SVM in which hybrid algorithm provides more accuracy compared to the other 3 ML algorithms. The Main objective of the proposed method is to predict the user reviews for choosing a best mobile using several classification Algorithms."
w,"In recent years, healthcare has attracted much attention, which is looking for more and more data analytics in healthcare to relieve medical problems in medical staff shortage, ageing population, people living alone, and quality of life. Data mining, analysis, and forecasting play a vital role in modern social and medical fields. However, how to select a proper model to mine and analyze the relevant medical information in the data is not only an extremely challenging problem, but also a concerning problem. Tuberculosis remains a major global health problem despite recent and continued progress in prevention and treatment. There is no doubt that the effective analysis and accurate forecasting of global tuberculosis prevalence rates lay a solid foundation for the construction of an epidemic disease warning and monitoring system from a global perspective. In this paper, the tuberculosis prevalence rate time series for four World Bank income groups are targeted. Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance and multiple comparison tests are conducted to determine whether the differences of tuberculosis prevalence rates for different income groups are statistically significant or not, and a novel combined forecasting model with its weights optimized by a recently developed artificial intelligence algorithmcuckoo searchis proposed to forecast the hierarchical tuberculosis prevalence rates from 2013 to 2016. Numerical results show that the developed combination model is not only simple, but is also able to satisfactorily approximate the actual tuberculosis prevalence rate, and can be an effective tool in mining and analyzing big data in the medical field."
w,"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare for patients with chronic diseases, including cancer. Barriers to healthcare increased, especially for racial and ethnic minorities. While many institutions developed webinars to educate community members, few webinars used a community-based participatory approach, employed a theory-based engagement design, and were evaluated. This manuscript reports the outcomes of Vamos a educarnos contra el cancer, a 2021 webinar series. Monthly educational webinars were conducted in Spanish on cancer-related topics. The presentations were delivered by Spanish-speaking content experts from different organizations. Webinars were conducted using the video conferencing platform Zoom. Polls were launched during the webinar to collect data and evaluate each webinar. The RE-AIM model of reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance was used to evaluate the series. The SAS Analytics Software was used for analysis and data management. Two hundred ninety-seven people participated with over 3000 views of the webinar recordings (Reach); 90% rated the sessions as good or excellent (Effectiveness); 86% agreed to adopt or improve a cancer-related behavior, and 90% reported willingness to adopt or improve a cancer-related action for someone else (Adoption); 92% reported feeling engaged (Implementation). The series has produced a resource library, manual of operations, and agreement of the Hispanic/Latino Cancer Community Advisory Board (CAB) to continue the webinar series in the future (Maintenance). Overall, these results highlight the impact of this webinar series and provide a standard approach to planning, delivering, and evaluating webinars as a strategy for cancer prevention and control in a culturally appropriate manner."

w,"As a result of measures related to the liquidation of inefficient universities and low-quality education, the university network of Russia in 2013-2019 has significantly changed its configuration. In particular, the total number of universities decreased by 42%, including parent universities by 23%, branches by 56%. At the same time, the number of students decreased by 33% over the same period, the reform occurred during a period of demographic decline in the youth age cohorts. However, the consequences of the reform to optimize the network of universities could have a different impact on the structure of urban and regional higher education systems in different parts of the country. Most of the federal and departmental statistics describing the situation in the field of higher education, and, accordingly, the results of research, are presented at the national or regional levels. However, almost all universities are located in cities, and this key level from the point of view of spatial localization of educational institutions falls out of the pool of educational analytics and research. Large cities everywhere attract young people with a wide range of factors. One of them is the possibility of choosing a university and an educational program. Other factors are related to the quality of the environment and services, the breadth and diversity of the labor market, which positively distinguish large cities from less populated places. The available data do not allow us to divide the migration attractiveness of the city for young people into those related to the presence of a university and the quality of educational services provided by it and those related to other possible factors of attractiveness. However, we can analyze whether the representation of universities in cities of different sizes is correlated with their migration attractiveness, expressed in net migration indicators of 15-19-year-olds. The conducted research has shown that the cities with a population of over 250 thousand people are the most attractive for migration and at the same time the least subjected to the reorganization of the university network. The concentration of universities in the largest cities of the country contributes to the strengthening of centripetal migration of young people. Small towns have experienced the main consequences of the implementation of state policy measures aimed at improving the quality of higher education. For many applicants from small and medium-sized cities, having one university or branch was the only opportunity to get a higher education without leaving their hometown."
w,"Urbanization's rapid progress has modernized many people's lives but also engendered big issues, such as traffic congestion, energy consumption, and pollution. Urban computing aims to tackle these issues by using the data that has been generated in cities (e.g., traffic flow, human mobility, and geographical data). Urban computing connects urban sensing, data management, data analytics, and service providing into a recurrent process for an unobtrusive and continuous improvement of people's lives, city operation systems, and the environment. Urban computing is an interdisciplinary field where computer sciences meet conventional city-related fields, like transportation, civil engineering, environment, economy, ecology, and sociology in the context of urban spaces. This article first introduces the concept of urban computing, discussing its general framework and key challenges from the perspective of computer sciences. Second, we classify the applications of urban computing into seven categories, consisting of urban planning, transportation, the environment, energy, social, economy, and public safety and security, presenting representative scenarios in each category. Third, we summarize the typical technologies that are needed in urban computing into four folds, which are about urban sensing, urban data management, knowledge fusion across heterogeneous data, and urban data visualization. Finally, we give an outlook on the future of urban computing, suggesting a few research topics that are somehow missing in the community."
w,"Research still does not frequently use the concept of value creation through the application of big data analytics. Additionally, the internet serves as a limitless supply of knowledge that comes from different people all over the world and is delivered in a variety of ways, including text documents, photos, audio files, and video. Search engine is a tool used to find different types of information on the internet. The issue that frequently occurs when looking for information online is that the search results for the intended subject are frequently unrelated to the terms entered. In order to increase the relevance of the data obtained from the search results, the goal of this study is to implement the query expansion approach, which involves reformulating the initial query in order to add several phrases utilizing a thesaurus. The waterfall model was used in conjunction with the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in the research. The results showed that the creation of a document search engine based on an information retrieval system was able to enhance data relevance and the standard of document search outcomes in big data analysis. The recall results are higher due to the usage of query expansion, which allowed for the retrieval of more pertinent documents. It is clear that by adopting this technique, the relevancy of the data in the search system can be improved."
w,"The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) is a public-private-government partnership established during the Coronavirus pandemic to create a centralized data resource called the N3C data enclave. This resource contains individual-level health data from participating healthcare sites nationwide to support rapid collaborative analytics. N3C has enabled analytics within a cloud-based enclave of data from electronic health records from over 17 million people (with and without COVID-19) in the USA. To achieve this goal of a shared data resource, N3C implemented a shared governance strategy involving stakeholders in decision-making. The approach leveraged best practices in data stewardship and team science to rapidly enable COVID-19-related research at scale while respecting the privacy of data subjects and participating institutions. N3C balanced equitable access to data, team-based scientific productivity, and individual professional recognition - a key incentive for academic researchers. This governance approach makes N3C research sustainable and effective beyond the initial days of the pandemic. N3C demonstrated that shared governance can overcome traditional barriers to data sharing without compromising data security and trust. The governance innovations described herein are a helpful framework for other privacy-preserving data infrastructure programs and provide a working model for effective team science beyond COVID-19."

w,"The health inequalities experienced by ethnic minorities have been a persistent and global phenomenon. The diagnosis of different types of skin conditions, e.g., melanoma, among people of color is one of such health domains where misdiagnosis can take place, potentially leading to life-threatening consequences. Although Caucasians are more likely to be diagnosed with melanoma, African Americans are four times more likely to present stage IV melanoma due to delayed diagnosis. It is essential to recognize that additional factors such as socioeconomic status and limited access to healthcare services can be contributing factors. African Americans are also 1.5 times more likely to die from melanoma than Caucasians, with 5-year survival rates for African Americans significantly lower than for Caucasians (72.2% vs. 89.6%). This is a complex problem compounded by several factors: ill-prepared medical practitioners, lack of awareness of melanoma and other skin conditions among people of colour, lack of information and medical resources for practitioners' continuous development, under-representation of people of colour in research, POC being a notoriously hard to reach group, and 'whitewashed' medical school curricula. Whilst digital technology can bring new hope for the reduction of health inequality, the deployment of artificial intelligence in healthcare carries risks that may amplify the health disparities experienced by people of color, whilst digital technology may provide a false sense of participation. For instance, Derm Assist, a skin diagnosis phone application which is under development, has already been criticized for relying on data from a limited number of people of color. This paper focuses on understanding the problem of misdiagnosing skin conditions in people of color and exploring the progress and innovations that have been experimented with, to pave the way to the possible application of big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and user-centred technology to reduce health inequalities among people of color."
w,"In the current era of big data, huge volumes of valuable data have been generated and collected at a rapid velocity from a wide variety of rich data sources. In recent years, the initiates of open data also led to the willingness of many government, researchers, and organizations to share their data and make them publicly accessible. An example of open big data is healthcare, disease and epidemiological data such as privacy-preserving statistics on patients who suffered from epidemic diseases like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Analyzing these open big data can be for social good. For instance, analyzing and mining the disease statistics helps people to get a better understanding of the disease, which may inspire them to take part in preventing, detecting, controlling and combating the disease. As a picture is worth a thousand words, having the pictorial representation further enhances people's understanding of the data and the corresponding results for the analysis and mining. Hence, in this paper, we present a visual data science solution for the visualization and visual analytics of big sequential data. We illustrate the ideas through the visualization and visual analytics of sequences of real-life COVID-19 epidemiological data. Our solution enables people to visualize COVID-19 epidemiological data and their temporal trends. It also allows people to visually analyze the data and discover relationships among popular features associated with the COVID-19 cases. Evaluation of these real-life sequential COVID-19 epidemiological data demonstrates the effectiveness of our visual data science solution in enhancing user experience in the visualization and visual analytics of big sequential data."
w,"Medical care services are changing to address problems with the development of big data frameworks as a result of the widespread use of big data analytics. Covid illness has recently been one of the leading causes of death in people. Since then, related input chest X-ray image for diagnosing COVID illness have been enhanced by diagnostic tools. Big data technological breakthroughs provide a fantastic option for reducing contagious Covid disease. To increase the model's confidence, it is necessary to integrate a large number of training sets, however handling the data may be difficult. With the development of big data technology, a unique method to identify and categorise covid illness is now found in this research. In order to manage incoming big data, a massive volume of chest x-ray images is gathered and analysed using a distributed computing server built on the Hadoop framework. In order to group identical groups in the input x-ray images, which in turn segments the dominating portions of an image, the fuzzy empowered weighted k-means algorithm is then employed. A hybrid quantum dilated convolution neural network is suggested to classify various kinds of covid instances, and a Black Widow-based Moth Flame is also shown to improve the performance of the classifier pattern. The performance analysis of COVID-19 detection makes use of the COVID-19 radiography dataset. The suggested HQDCNet approach has an accuracy of 99.01. The experimental results are evaluated in Python using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure, and loss function."
w,"Advancements in recent networking and information technology have always been a natural phenomenon. The exponential amount of data generated by the people in their day-to-day lives results in the rise of Big Data Analytics (BDA). Cognitive computing is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based system that can reduce the issues faced during BDA. On the other hand, Sentiment Analysis (SA) is employed to understand such linguistic based tweets, feature extraction, compute subjectivity and sentimental texts placed in these tweets. The application of SA on big data finds it useful for businesses to take commercial benefits insight from text-oriented content. In this view, this paper presents new cognitive computing with the big data analysis tool for SA. The proposed model involves various process such as pre-processing, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. For handling big data, Hadoop Map Reduce tool is used. The proposed model initially undergoes pre-processing to remove the unwanted words. Then, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is utilized as a feature extraction technique to extract the set of feature vectors. Besides, a Binary Brain Storm Optimization (BBSO) algorithm is being used for the Feature Selection (FS) process and thereby achieving improved classification performance. Moreover, Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are used as a classifier to classify the incidence of positive or negative sentiments. A comprehensive experimental results analysis ensures the better performance of the presented BBSO-FCM model on the benchmark dataset. The obtained experimental values highlights the improved classification performance of the proposed BBSOFCM model in terms of different measures."
w,"The vision of the Internet of Things is to allow currently unconnected physical objects to be connected to the internet. There will be an extremely large number of internet connected devices that will be much more than the number of human being in the world all producing data. These data will be collected and delivered to the cloud for processing, especially with a view of finding meaningful information to then take action. However, ideally the data needs to be analysed locally to increase privacy, give quick responses to people and to reduce use of network and storage resources. To tackle these problems, distributed data analytics can be proposed to collect and analyse the data either in the edge or fog devices. In this paper, we explore a hybrid approach which means that both innetwork level and cloud level processing should work together to build effective IoT data analytics in order to overcome their respective weaknesses and use their specific strengths. Specifically, we collected raw data locally and extracted features by applying data fusion techniques on the data on resource constrained devices to reduce the data and then send the extracted features to the cloud for processing. We evaluated the accuracy and data consumption over network and thus show that it is feasible to increase privacy and maintain accuracy while reducing data communication demands."
w,"Learning Tomorrow is a program at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS) that stimulates the use of digital tools to enable a more personal, informal and collaborative way of working within the university. Moreover, it raises awareness of sedentary behavior, to support its students and staff physical activity. This paper discusses a first study that was conducted to understand the current state of physical activity within the context of the AUAS. With the use of QS (Quantified Self) technology, data was gathered from a 4-week field trial in which 24 participants (both students and teachers) used a Fitbit and a GPS tracker. The collected data was analyzed to find out whether the use of specific technology and tools would lead to a better overview of people's physical activity. This study also aims to evaluate the effectiveness of using a visual analytics tool [11] to facilitate insight into how this daily physical activity data yields to reflective learning in order to promote continuous learning and improve future experiences. The results indicate that the combination of both GPS tracking and a Fitbit for stated period, with only a limited number of participants, can deliver a clear overview of physical activity in general and more specifically of routes that are taken. However, results also indicate that data alone is not everything either. Contextual understanding was found to be a vital addition."
w,"Background: There is growing evidence suggesting that the emotional well-being of the public has been negatively affected in the past year. Consequently, demand for well-being support has increased. Although there is substantial empirical support for mental health apps that target diagnosed conditions, there is less research on emotional well-being apps. Among existing well-being apps, few studies have been conducted on apps that are based on lived experience and those that seek to enhance users' understanding of their emotional patterns. Thus, the acceptability of these novel apps requires further evaluation before upscaling. Objective: This evaluation aims to describe the acceptability, engagement, and preliminary outcomes of using an app (Paradym) designed to promote emotional well-being and positive mental health. Methods: This is a pre-post, mixed-methods, single-arm evaluation that is aggregated with digital analytics data. We anonymously collected real-world data on the demographics and well-being of the participants as well as the usability and acceptance of the app using validated questionnaires and open-ended questions. Participants tested the app for a minimum of 2 weeks before completing the follow-up measures. Google Analytics was used to record the level of app engagement. Chi-square and 2-tailed t tests were conducted to analyze quantitative data, and a thematic analysis approach was adopted for qualitative data. Results: A total of 115 participants completed baseline questionnaires, of which 79.1% (91/115) users downloaded the app. The sample was diverse in terms of ethnicity, including 43.4% (50/115) people who self-identified as belonging to minority ethnic groups. Most of the participants were female (78/115, 67.8%) and between the ages of 18 and 25 years (39/115, 33.9%). A total of 34 app users who completed questionnaires at baseline and follow-up provided valuable feedback to inform the future directions of Paradym. Favorable themes emerged describing the app's content, functionality, and underlying principles. Although usability feedback varied across items, a considerable number of participants (22/34, 64%) found that the app was easy to use. Google Analytics revealed that at least 79% (27/34) of people used the app daily. On the basis of preliminary observations, app users experience increased mental well-being. Post hoc analyses indicated that the reduction in depression scores (t(33)=-2.16) and the increase in the well-being measures (t(33)=2.87) were statistically significant. No adverse events were reported during the follow-up period. Conclusions: The findings of this evaluation are encouraging and document positive preliminary evidence for the Paradym app."
w,"Background and Objectives: For preventing postoperative delirium (POD), identifying the risk factors is important. However, the relationship between blood transfusion and POD is still controversial. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors of POD, to evaluate the impact of blood transfusion in developing POD among people undergoing spinal fusion surgery, and to show the effectiveness of big data analytics using a clinical data warehouse (CDW). Materials and Methods: The medical data of patients who underwent spinal fusion surgery were obtained from the CDW of the five hospitals of Hallym University Medical Center. Clinical features, laboratory findings, perioperative variables, and medication history were compared between patients without POD and with POD. Results: 234 of 3967 patients (5.9%) developed POD. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk factors of POD were as follows: Parkinson's disease (OR 5.54, 95% CI 2.15-14.27; p < 0.001), intensive care unit (OR 3.45 95% CI 2.42-4.91; p < 0.001), anti-psychotics drug (OR 3.35 95% CI 1.91-5.89; p < 0.001), old age (>= 70 years) (OR 3.08, 95% CI 2.14-4.43; p < 0.001), depression (OR 2.8 95% CI 1.27-6.2; p < 0.001). The intraoperative transfusion (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.91-1.34; p = 0.582), and the postoperative transfusion (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74-1.12; p = 0.379) had no statistically significant effect on the incidence of POD. Conclusions: There was no relationship between perioperative blood transfusion and the incidence of POD in spinal fusion surgery. Big data analytics using a CDW could be helpful for the comprehensive understanding of the risk factors of POD, and for preventing POD in spinal fusion surgery."
w,"Workforce management is important in organisational performance. However, executives lament that their workforce management efforts remain ineffective. This comes as no surprise, as workforce measurement poses a challenge for several reasons: the many different conceptualisations of the workforce, which developed in parallel, and flawed workforce analytics, hence inadequate workforce intelligence, are among the most significant. To have the right people available requires timely and accurate information and intelligence to make evidence-based decisions. In order to achieve this proper measurement is required, which forms part of the information system that ensures the availability of the right people, at the right place, at the right time. People measurement/metrics, is a neglected area of research, which is receiving increased attention. Though little, if any, attention is devoted to the link between people as dimension of competitive advantage and metrics to ensure the availability of the right people, at the right place at the right time. Our conceptual paper attends to this omission by reflecting on the different conceptualisations of 'workforce' by integrating the diverse and fragmented literature, which has not been done before, and linking it with workforce measurement. In so doing, we provide a more comprehensive understanding of 'workforce' and workforce measurement, ensuring alignment with organisational strategy to secure a competitive advantage and, thus, organisational performance. We also propose an integrated framework to measure and manage the workforce. It transpired that of the many tools available, predictive analytics emerged as the most effective means to measure and manage the workforce successfully. Our paper benefits both academics and practitioners as theoretical ambiguities and tensions are clarified while ensuring the availability of the requisite workforce."
w,"The bi-directional flow of energy and information in the smart grid makes it possible to record and analyze the electricity consumption profiles of consumers. Because of the increasing rate of inflation over the past few years, people started looking for means to use electricity illegally, termed as electricity theft. Many data analytics techniques are proposed in the literature for electricity theft detection (ETD). These techniques help in the detection of suspected illegal consumers. However, the existing approaches have a low ETD rate either due to improper handling of the imbalanced class problem in a dataset or the selection of inappropriate classifier. In this paper, a robust big data analytics technique is proposed to resolve the aforementioned concerns. Firstly, adaptive synthesis (ADASYN) is applied to handle the imbalanced class problem of data. Secondly convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) integrated deep siamese network (DSN) are proposed to discriminate the features of both honest and fraudulent consumers. Specifically, the task of feature extraction from weekly energy consumption profiles is handed over to the CNN module while the LSTM module performs the sequence learning. Finally, the DSN contemplates on the shared features provided by the CNN-LSTM and applies final judgment. The data analytics is performed on different train-test ratios of the real-time smart meters' data. The simulation results validate the proposed model's effectiveness in terms of high area under the curve, F-1-Score, precision and recall. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
w,"Social media applications have become an integral part of our life, business and society today. Due to their increasing number of users and growing popularity, many organisations use them as a medium to generate income. The businesses use social media analytics and advertisements to increase their revenue. Although social media applications were initially built to connect people across the globe, they have now turned into one of the most favoured ways of propagation of cyber crimes. Most users lack cyber awareness and fall prey to the malicious activities distributed via Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and advertisements. When a user visits the malicious URL, it makes the hackers privy to a lot of personal and sensitive information of the user. To overcome the problem of malicious URLs victimising users we propose a tool deployed as a chrome extension. This tool, analyses URLs and classifies them using two different neural networks, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks which is a specific type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The major objective of the proposed model is to aid the users to avoid becoming a victim of malicious and fraudulent activities like malicious URLs, phishing and social engineering that favour social media as their target medium by detecting them accurately. The model proposed is scalable, easy to train and compatible with devices of varied hardware specifications. The proposed model gives excellent accuracy and overcomes several issues faced by the existing systems."
w,"Brazil took the willing commitment through the 1988 Federal Constitution to organize human resources training in the health sector adopting the usage of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and implementing multiple actions to intervene in professional training and performance qualifying professionals in the health system. Among these there is the Unified Health System Open University (UNA-SUS), created to meet continuing health professionals education needs using distance education. Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ) makes up this network offering free courses, specialization programs, improvement and extension in distance education format, semi-attending, tutored and self-instructional. Internet is constantly evolving and global reaching, and social Medias, mainly Facebook, are tools for interaction, dissemination and one of the largest communication multipliers contacting different cultural, political, economic and social levels. In this scenario, public and private companies transfer efforts to direct communication and interaction practices using them as brand promotion tools, values dissemination and also information transition regarding services to citizens. This study target was identifying and analyzing UNA-SUS/UERJ students social and digital profiles so as the feasibility of the Facebook usage as a communication tool and dissemination of Institutional info. A Profile Assessment Form of the Legalization courses in Health, Violence Home Care, Elderly Care and Family Health was available online in order to analyze students social and digital profiles in 2013-2014. To assess the relevance and potential usage of Facebook as a tool to map and track followers profile, identify people involvement and institution posts achievement; we have used the UNA-SUS/UERJ Facebook page. To obtain the data, we have page information display screen-shots, fan categories, involved and reached in the last 30 days. We have used the stats obtained using Google Analytics implemented in the UNA-SUS/UERJ website. The User Profile Assessment Questionnaire was answered by students and served as a quantitative analysis in which 84% of participants are female from 21 to 35 years old; 73% use internet more than once a day and 86% have a Facebook profile. Throughout the 1,581 followers of the Facebook page, 80% are female from 25 to 34 years old (42%). The interaction, likes, comments and shares were 77% from women most of them from 25 to 34 years old. We highlight the reach beyond Brazil's borders with 335 users in Portugal and nearly 100 people from Spain and USA. Using Google Analytics statistical reports analysis, we have observed that Facebook is responsible for a large portion of the traffic origin with 48% of users and 16% of these 48% access via Facebook Mobile i.e. using mobile gadgets, have also analyzed that 8136 visitors are from Brazil, but have also seen also a global reach as we could identify access in other countries. We have found that the vast majority of their students have good infoculture and daily internet access, and also have Facebook profile. We have also noted that the traffic generated to the UNA-SUS/UERJ website of, and therefore access to courses information, are mostly originated from the referenced social network. Results-driven, we can conclude that Facebook can be used as an additional resource and should be further explored as a strategic communication and dissemination tool for UNA-SUS/UERJ courses."
w,"Objective: This study compared traditional statistical methods to different predictive analytics methods on the endpoint of multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse. Study setting: This is a secondary data analysis on four different MS Centers based on the third year of data, July 2019-June 2020. Study design: The parent study is a two-part, 3-year clinical quality improvement prospective study that started in June 2017 and concluded in June 2020, and utilizes a prospective stepped-wedge randomized design. Binary logistic regression was compared with other machine learning models, specifically ridge, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and random forest. Data collection: This study used electronic health record data extracted at the individual level and `rolled up' to the system and population level. Inclusion criteria included participants aged 18 years or older, with MS presenting to any of the four centers, who entered the study in any quarter. Exclusion criteria included cases with missing or incorrectly input data and those who refused to participate in the study. Principal findings: When comparing relapse indices across models, random forest significantly outperformed logistic regression and other machine learning algorithms (Delta perf(A) =27.1%, Delta perf(M) =27.5%). However, for Delta perf(F), logistic regression and random forest performed relatively the same. Ridge and LASSO outperformed logistic regression (Delta perf(M1) =0.9%, Delta perf(M2) =9.4%, Delta perf(F2)=25.8%, respectively). Conclusion: Multiple sclerosis is a complex and costly chronic (3C) condition that currently has no cure. In a condition like MS, which has an unpredictable course, the use of predictive analytics could help health systems learn better, faster, and to improve more effectively and predict rather than react to emerging health needs for people with MS. Comparing the predictability of relapse across various models with a predictive analytics framework can potentially change how we manage MS care."
w,"To meet the challenge of analyzing rapidly growing graph and network data created by modern applications, a large number of graph databases have emerged, such as Neo4j and JanusGraph. They mainly target low-latency graph queries, such as finding the neighbors of a vertex with certain properties, and retrieving the shortest path between two vertices. Although many of the graph databases handle the graph-only queries very well, they fall short for real life applications involving graph analysis. This is because graph queries are not all that one does in an analytics workload of a real life application. They are often only a part of an integrated heterogeneous analytics pipeline, which may include SQL, machine learning, graph, and other analytics. This means graph queries need to be synergistic with other analytics. Unfortunately, most existing graph databases are standalone and cannot easily integrate with other analytics systems. In addition, many graph data (data about relationships between objects or people) are already prevalent in existing non-graph databases, although they are not explicitly stored as graphs. None of existing graph databases can retrofit graph queries onto these existing data without transferring or transforming data. In this paper, we propose an in-DBMS graph query approach, IBM Db2 Graph, to support synergistic and retrofittable graph queries inside the IBM Db2Trelational database. It is implemented as a layer inside Db2, and thus can support integrated graph and SQL analytics efficiently. Db2 Graph employs a novel graph overlay approach to expose a graph view of the relational data. This approach flexibly retrofits graph queries to existing graph data stored in relational tables, without expensive data transfer or transformation. In addition, it enables efficient execution of graph queries with the help of Db2 relational engine, through sophisticated compile-time and runtime optimization strategies. Our experimental study, as well as our experience with real customers using Db2 Graph, showed that Db2 Graph can provide very competitive and sometimes even better performance on graph-only queries, compared to existing graph databases. Moreover, it optimizes the overall performance of complex analytics workloads."
w,"The purpose of this study was to analyze the biomechanics of the ideal grip on the traditional game of slingshots. This study used quantitative methods that were described in detail using descriptive analytics with a one-shot case study design. The sample in this study consisted of 10 people who were activists of the traditional slingshot game in Semarang Regency and filled out complete consent information as a willingness to participate in the research to completion. The data in this study is in the form of kinematic data obtained from the results of video analysis using Kinovea software version 0.9.5. The quantitative data in this study is in the form of a recap of kinematic data consisting of 3 phases, namely the preparation phase; the release phase; and the follow-through phase. The results of this study found that the preparatory phase had an average grip angle of 99.08 +/- 5,995 degrees. Grip angle data at release phase 99.66 +/- 4.977 degrees. This study found the conclusion that the ideal grip is a straight hand position parallel to the pull of the arm until an angle of approximately 90 degrees is formed with the slingshot position slightly tilted, this position can provide enough space for the other hand to pull the slingshot rubber back. So that the pull carried out can be maximized and can be adjusted to the intended target distance. It is expected that further research can discuss the analysis of pull length and shot accuracy."
w,"In the changing environment of the 21st century, universities should develop very innovative ecosystems by doing right investments on human capital, research and development, buildings, laboratories, dorms, and other facilities on the campus while decreasing their costs and expenses in order to increase scientific and technological oriented innovations and outputs. For that reason, most of them are looking toward Big Data Management (BDM), which is a very new and dynamic subject to conduct properly and to make right decisions at the universities. Data analytics and data mining have increased and attracted the attention of most of the leaders, managers, administrators, researchers, and even educators who try to make massive data-related investments and decisions. More importantly, since the funding of higher education has become important issues for most of the governments and higher education management, the importance of BDM will increase in higher education much more than ever before. However, not all the universities are so successful in managing their small or medium-sized data. In this research, how universities are investing by improving their data was analyzed in three different universities in Istanbul. More strategically, how data analytics and mining can make changes and transformation higher education institutions by investing right resources under the promise of Big Data Management was critically studied. In this study, the impacts of big data mining and management on higher education institutions' sustainable funding, financing, planning, success, research and development, and innovation were critically studied. By taking into account the perceptions and the experiences of the experienced experts (6), faculty members (12), managers (4), and technical people (12), who were charged in using data analytics and mining at two state and one private universities, the investment of the universities had analyzed in order to understand critically the effects of the BDM. In the study, the phenomenological analysis was used by asking thirty-one research questions in the semi-structured interviews. While taking into account the observations of the researchers, the collected data of this study were systematically studied in data analysis software-program NVivo 10. The results showed that a few number of the investments had correctly done by using data mining and data analysis. As the participants had mentioned that the data would not have done anything if the higher education management had not taken into account and applied. So, according to the participants (75%), the university management understanding and policies should be changed in order to take in consideration the results of the big data. Even though a great amount of data had produced through the systems of the universities, the analysis, the segmentation, and the selected attention of the data had become dependent on the higher education management. The participants (28%), who were active in planning, funding, and investing, agreed that the investments done according to the results of the big data had better educational, financial, socio-economic, cultural, technological, environmental, and even individual benefits and outcomes. In conclusion, although a little data mining and analysis has properly used in making right investments, the universities are highly convinced on the positive effects of the BDM in their short-term and long-term investments in order to increase their impacts."
w,"Background: Transition from paediatric to adult heath care services is a challenging time for many adolescents with chronic illnesses and may include deterioration in illness control as a consequence of inadequate self-management skills, poor understanding of their chronic illness and failure to engage with adult services. Successful transfer of health care requires the development of self-management skills and increased autonomy. Mobile technology has been proposed as a modality to assist this process. Evidence is limited and generally restricted to illness specific applications. The TransitionMate app (TMApp) is a generic (non-illness specific) mobile application designed to support young people with chronic illness in their transition from paediatric to adult health care services. The overall aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of TMApp in improving engagement and retention of adolescents with chronic illness within adult healthcare services, as well as preventing the deterioration in illness control and unplanned hospitalisations. Methods: The TransitionMate trial is a dual centre, pragmatic, single arm, mixed methods cohort study conducted within two university teaching tertiary paediatric hospitals in Australia. Data collection points are planned at 0, 6, 12 and 18 months. Outcome indicators include: usage of TransitionMate, engagement with adult services, quantitative markers of illness control, and unplanned hospital admissions. Data are collected through telephone interviews with the participants, their primary healthcare providers, electronic medical records and de-identified mobile application analytics. The development of the application involved co-design with recently transitioned young people with a number of chronic illnesses as well as online user experience in younger adolescents. Discussion: The TransitionMate study is the first identified trial of a generic mobile application designed to support adolescents with chronic illnesses during the transition process. Results are expected to provide novel insights into the value of technological tools in the transition space, especially their effectiveness in improving both the transition process and clinical outcomes of adolescents with chronic illnesses. Furthermore, the approach of a pragmatic study design may help identify research methods better designed to overcome inherent challenges in research involving adolescents, transition of care and use of mobile application technology."
w,"The National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools (NCCMT) has developed several resources to support evidence-informed decision-making - the process of distilling and disseminating best available evidence from research, context, and experience - and knowledge translation, applying best evidence in practice. One such resource, the Registry of Methods and Tools, is a free online database of 195 methods and tools to support knowledge translation. Building on the identification of webinars as a strategy to improve the dissemination of information, NCCMT launched the Spotlight on Knowledge Translation Methods and Tools webinar series in 2012 to promote awareness and use of the Registry. To inform continued implementation of this webinar series, NCCMT conducted an evaluation of the series' potential to improve awareness and use of the methods/tools within the Registry, as well as identify areas for improvement and what worked. For this evaluation, the following data were analyzed: electronic follow-up surveys administered immediately following each webinar; an additional electronic survey administered 6 months after two webinars; and Google Analytics for each webinar. As of November 2015, there have been 22 webinars conducted, reaching 2048 people in multiple sectors across Canada and around the world. Evaluation results indicate that the webinars increase awareness about the Registry and stimulate use of the methods/tools. Although webinar attendees were significantly less likely to have used the methods/tools 6 months after webinars, this may be attributed to the lack of an identified opportunity in their work to use the method/tool. Despite technological challenges and requests for further examples of how the methods/tools have been used, there is overwhelming positive feedback that the format, presenters, content, and interaction across webinars worked. This evaluation supports that webinars are a valuable strategy for increasing awareness and stimulating use of resources for evidence-informed decision-making and knowledge translation in public health practice."
w,"Background: The present study aims to identify the patients at risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). There is a body of literature that uses machine learning classification algorithms to predict development of T2D among patients. The current study compares the performance of these classification algorithms to identify patients who are at risk of developing T2D in short, medium and long terms. In addition, the list of predictor variables important for prediction for T2D progression is provided. Methods: This study uses 10,911 records generated in 36 clinics from the 15th of November 2008-15th of November 2016. Syntactic minority oversampling and random under sampling were used to create a balanced dataset. The performance of Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tress and Logistic Regression to identify patients developing T2D in short, medium and long terms was compared. The measures were Area Under Curve, Sensitivity, Specificity, Matthew correlation coefficient and Mean Calibration Error. Through importance analysis and information fusion techniques the predictors of developing T2D were identified for short, medium and long-term risk analysis. Results: The findings show that the performance of analytics techniques depends on both period and purpose of prediction whether the prediction is to identify people who will not develop T2D or to determine at risk patients. Oversampling as opposed to under sampling improved performance. 16 predictors and their importance to determine patients at risk of T2D in short, medium and long terms were identified. Conclusions: This study provides guidelines for an automated system to prompt patients for screening. Several predictors are reportable by patients, others can be examined by physicians or ordered for further lab examination, which offers a potential reduction of the burden placed upon the clinical settings."
w,"With the spiraling pandemic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has becoming inherently important to disseminate accurate and timely information about the disease. Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic AI-driven sensing paradigm to extract real-time observations from online users. In this paper, we propose CovidSens, a vision of social sensing-based risk alert systems to spontaneously obtain and analyze social data to infer the state of the COVID-19 propagation. CovidSens can actively help to keep the general public informed about the COVID-19 spread and identify risk-prone areas by inferring future propagation patterns. The CovidSens concept is motivated by three observations: (1) people have been actively sharing their state of health and experience of the COVID-19 via online social media, (2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting their observations and experiences about COVID-19 on social media, and (3) online users are frequently equipped with substantially capable mobile devices that are able to perform non-trivial on-device computation for data processing and analytics. We envision an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the posts generated by the ordinary people to build a real-time sensing and analytic system for gathering and circulating vital information of the COVID-19 propagation. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions: How to distill reliable information about the COVID-19 with the coexistence of prevailing rumors and misinformation in the social media? How to inform the general public about the latest state of the spread timely and effectively, and alert them to remain prepared? How to leverage the computational power on the edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices, UAVs) to construct fully integrated edge-based social sensing platforms for rapid detection of the COVID-19 spread? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify the potential challenges in developing reliable social sensing-based risk alert systems. We envision that approaches originating from multiple disciplines (e.g., AI, estimation theory, machine learning, constrained optimization) can be effective in addressing the challenges. Finally, we outline a few research directions for future work in CovidSens."
w,"Providing optimal rehabilitation services to the broad public is one of the greatest challenges in the healthcare sector due to the shortage of rehabilitation physicians and facilities. Recent advances in digitalization and sophisticated data analytics offers new innovative ways in delivering rehabilitation services to enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities. Currently, the development of data-driven solutions for rehabilitation in Malaysia is limited due to multiple factors: medical and rehabilitation data is not digitally stored; the knowledge for the interpretation of clinical data is distributed; in particular, there is a lack of expertise in the field of medical data science. Thus, a data science platform is proposed so that medical expertise can be made available through digital services and is not dependent on human resource, location, time or financial ability. This platform is applied for the smart diagnosis of upper limb spasticity in compliance with clinical practice, and extensible for the other smart rehabilitation applications. By collaborating with the prestigious Fraunhofer Society, their knowhow in industrial data science can be brought to Malaysia towards improved health care in the country. The smart diagnosis system provides advice in classifying the severity level of upper limb spasticity based on the Modified Ashworth Scale and the Modified Tardieu scale. The basis is a measurement system for muscle signal, muscle tone and elbow motion. Users of the smart diagnosis application include rehabilitation physicians, doctors from other specialities, nurses, psychologists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. The tools provided by the data science platform is deployed to store and analyze the clinical data. Further, the expertise of a rehabilitation physician is emulated in the form of an expert system to determine the severity level of upper limb spasticity. The digital clinical database helps medical researchers in secondary analysis towards knowledge discovery for the betterment of intervention and treatment of spasticity. (C) 2020 The Authors.

w,"In information systems research, the advantages of Customer Experience (CX) and its contribution to organizations are largely recognized. The CX analytics evaluate how customers perceive products, ranging from their functional usage to their cognitive states regarding the product, such as emotions, sentiment, and satisfaction. The most recent research in psychology reveals that cognition analytics research based on Classical Probability Theory (CPT) and statistical learning, which is used to evaluate people's cognitive states, is limited due to their reliance on rational decision-making. However, the cognitive attitudes of customers are characterized by uncertainty and entanglement, resulting in irrational decision-making bias. What is captured by traditional CPT-based data science in the context of cognition aspects of CX analytics is only a small portion of what should be captured. Current CX analytics efforts fall far short of their full potential. In this paper, we set a novel research direction for CX analytics by Quantum Probability Theory (QPT). QPT-based analytics have been introduced recently in psychology research and reveal better cognition assessment under uncertainty, with a high level of irrational behavior. Adopting recent advances in the psychology domain, this paper develops a vision and sets a research agenda for expanding the application of CX analytics by QPT to overcome CPT shortcomings, identifies research areas that contribute to the vision, and proposes elements of a future research agenda. To stimulate debate and research QPT-CX analytics, we attempt a preliminary characterization of the novel method by introducing a QPT-based rich mathematical framework for CX cognitive modeling based on quantum superposition, Bloch sphere, and Hilbert space. We demonstrate the implementation of the QPT-CX model by the use case of customers' emotional motivator assessments while implementing quantum vector space with a set of mathematical axioms for CX analytics. Finally, we outline the key advantages of quantum CX over classical by supporting theoretical proof for each key."
w,"This paper introduces an innovative approach to low-energy-low-carbon design for a new hospital in the UK. This innovation is achieved through an analysis of hospital operational policies and the impact of them on this performance. The analysis leads to new information and data, and it will be explained how this has a significant impact on the engineering design for the hospital's environmental systems. The work is a significant point of departure from conventional design practice, which largely focuses on the asset specification of the facility as a means for the achievement of this performance. There is now clear evidence that demonstrates that UK hospitals are failing to achieve the performance required by the UK Government's Carbon Reduction Commitment and this calls in to question how improved performance can be achieved by improved asset specifications alone. The primary source of this evidence emanates from the National Health Service (NHS) Sustainability Development Unit (2009. Executive summary. In D. Pencheon (Ed.), Saving carbon, improving health (pp.8-9). Cambridge: NHS Sustainable Development Unit), which reports that actual carbon emissions from hospital buildings are increasing not falling, and that the rate of increase is diametrically opposite to that which is required (subsequent reports confirm this trend). The innovation presented in this paper concerns the development of a new building science called as 'Occupancy Analytics', the objective of which is to address this situation by providing new knowledge about how hospitals are used and then to use this knowledge to transform the engineering design process (and in the future: hospital operational management). The background to Occupancy Analytics is based on the assertion that as it is people that consume energy and not hospital facilities, then we should seek to understand how they are used and in particular how the working practices and processes (operational policies) of use impact energy consumption and carbon emissions. The importance of understanding occupancy is of fundamental importance to building science and has long been recognised as such within the building engineering profession. For example, it is the one major factor that determines the sizing and control of the engineering systems. In this paper, the author sets out the arguments for developing a new understanding of occupancy rather then reliance on formulaic principles (which largely characterises conventional design engineering design practice) that lead to poorly informed engineering solutions, which then lead to poor energy and carbon performance in UK hospitals. Occupancy Analytics has been implemented on a major new acute hospital in the UK. The objective of the implementation has been to establish a new benchmark in hospital energy and carbon performance. It will demonstrate how the development of new knowledge concerning occupancy should lead to a radical improvement in hospital performance. The results of the work undertaken so far have been substantial in their impact. A major finding was that conventional design practice grossly over-estimates occupancy leading to the poor energy and carbon performance described earlier. However, using Occupancy Analytics the author forecasts a reduction in carbon emissions for the new hospital of 34% and a forecast energy performance of 28 GJ/100 m(3) or 280 kWh/m(2), which is comparable to the best performing hospitals in Scandinavia."
w,"Author summaryA densely populated, highly urban tropical city-state with long-established populations of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, plus travel and trade links to all corners of the world, Singapore is ideally suited for dengue transmission. Singapore's experience and rich surveillance data provide important insights for an increasingly large number of territories at risk of dengue epidemics. Decades of vector control efforts, focused on source reduction and surveillance, have successfully lowered the vector population, with accompanying reductions in the resident population's seroprevalence to dengue. We propose that Singapore's vulnerability to outbreaks is due to low levels of immunity in the population, constant introduction of viral variants, expanding urban centres, and increasing human density. The discord between the rising trend in reported cases and falling seroprevalence could be at least partly attributed to improved diagnostics and surveillance. Singapore's evidence-based vector-control programme, which involves strong partnership between the public and private sectors, will continue to adapt to future challenges in this space. This paper summarises the lessons learnt in dengue epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention in Singapore over the last half a century, during which Singapore evolved from a city of 1.9 million people to a highly urban globalised city-state with a population of 5.6 million. Set in a tropical climate, urbanisation among green foliage has created ideal conditions for the proliferation of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, the mosquito vectors that transmit dengue. A vector control programme, largely for malaria, was initiated as early as 1921, but it was only in 1966 that the Vector Control Unit (VCU) was established to additionally tackle dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) that was first documented in the 1960s. Centred on source reduction and public education, and based on research into the bionomics and ecology of the vectors, the programme successfully reduced the Aedes House Index (HI) from 48% in 1966 to <5% in the 1970s. Further enhancement of the programme, including through legislation, suppressed the Aedes HI to around 1% from the 1990s. The current programme is characterised by 4 key features: (i) proactive inter-epidemic surveillance and control that is stepped up during outbreaks; (ii) risk-based prevention and intervention strategies based on advanced data analytics; (iii) coordinated inter-sectoral cooperation between the public, private, and people sectors; and (iv) evidence-based adoption of new tools and strategies. Dengue seroprevalence and force of infection (FOI) among residents have substantially and continuously declined over the 5 decades. This is consistent with the observation that dengue incidence has been delayed to adulthood, with severity highest among the elderly. Paradoxically, the number of reported dengue cases and outbreaks has increased since the 1990s with record-breaking epidemics. We propose that Singapore's increased vulnerability to outbreaks is due to low levels of immunity in the population, constant introduction of new viral variants, expanding urban centres, and increasing human density. The growing magnitude of reported outbreaks could also be attributed to improved diagnostics and surveillance, which at least partially explains the discord between rising trend in cases and the continuous reduction in dengue seroprevalence. Changing global and local landscapes, including climate change, increasing urbanisation and global physical connectivity are expected to make dengue control even more challenging. The adoption of new vector surveillance and control tools, such as the Gravitrap and Wolbachia technology, is important to impede the growing threat of dengue and other Aedes-borne diseases."
w,"Introduction: Recently, the tendency of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data use/ applications has been rapidly expanding across the globe, improving people's lifestyles with data-driven services (i.e., recommendations, smart healthcare, etc.). The synergy between AI and big data has become imperative considering the drastic growth in personal data stemming from diverse sources (cloud computing, IoT, social networks, etc.). However, when data meet AI at some central place, it invites unimaginable privacy issues, and one of those issues is group privacy. Despite being the most significant problem, group privacy has not yet received the attention of the research community it is due. Problem Statement: We study how to preserve the privacy of particular groups (a community of people with some common attributes/properties) rather than an individual in personal data handling (i.e., sharing, aggregating, and/or performing analytics, etc.), especially when we talk about groups purposely made by two or more people (with clear group identifying markers), for whom we need to protect their privacy as a group. Aims/Objectives: With this technical letter, our aim is to introduce a new dimension of privacy (e.g., group privacy) from technical perspectives to the research community. The main objective is to advocate the possibility of group privacy breaches when big data meet AI in real-world scenarios. Methodology: We set a hypothesis that group privacy (extracting group-level information) is a genuine problem, and can likely occur when AI-based techniques meet high dimensional and large-scale datasets. To prove our hypothesis, we conducted a substantial number of experiments on two real-world benchmark datasets using AI techniques. Based on the experimental analysis, we found that the likelihood of privacy breaches occurring at the group level by using AI techniques is very high when data are sufficiently large. Apart from that, we tested the parameter effect of AI techniques and found that some parameters' combinations can help to extract more and fine-grained data about groups. Findings: Based on experimental analysis, we found that vulnerability of group privacy can likely increase with the data size and capacity of the AI method. We found that some attributes of people can act as catalysts in compromising group privacy. We suggest that group privacy should also be given due attention as individual privacy is, and robust tools are imperative to restrict implications (i.e., biased decision making, denial of accommodation, hate speech, etc.) of group privacy. Significance of results: The obtained results are the first step towards responsible data science, and can pave the way to understanding the phenomenon of group privacy. Furthermore, the results contribute towards the protection of motives/goals/practices of minor communities in any society. Concluding statement: Due to the significant rise in digitation, privacy issues are mutating themselves. Hence, it is vital to quickly pinpoint emerging privacy threats and suggest practical remedies for them in order to mitigate their consequences on human beings."
w,"Advancement in Information Communication Technology (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has to lead to the continuous generation of a large amount of data. Smart city projects are being implemented in various parts of the world where analysis of public data helps in providing a better quality of life. Data analytics plays a vital role in many such data-driven applications. Real-time analytics for finding valuable insights at the right time using smart city data is crucial in making appropriate decisions for city administration. It is essential to use multiple data sources as input for the analysis to achieve better and more accurate data-driven solutions. It helps in finding more accurate solutions and making appropriate decisions. Public safety is one of the major concerns in any smart city project in which real-time analytics is much useful in the early detection of valuable data patterns. It is crucial to find early predictions of crime-related incidents and generating emergency alerts for making appropriate decisions to provide security to the people and safety of the city infrastructure. This paper discusses the proposed real-time big data analytics framework with data blending approach using multiple data sources for smart city applications. Analytics using multiple data sources for a specific data-driven solution helps in finding more data patterns, which in turn increases the accuracy of analytics results. The data preprocessing phase is a challenging task in data analytics when data being ingested continuously in real-time into the analytics system. The proposed system helps in the preprocessing of real-time data with data blending of multiple data sources used in the analytics. The proposed framework is beneficial when data from multiple sources are ingested in real-time as input data and is also flexible to use any additional data source of interest. The experimental work carried out with the proposed framework using multiple data sources to find the crime-related insights in real-time helps the public safety solutions in the smart city. The experimental outcome shows that there is a significant increase in the number of identified useful data patterns as the number of data sources increases. A real-time based emergency alert system to help the public safety solution is implemented using a machine learning-based classification algorithm with the proposed framework. The experiment is carried out with different classification algorithms, and the results show that Naive Bayes classification performs better in generating emergency alerts."
w,"Real-world evidence (RWE) is being used to provide information on diverse groups of patients who may be highly impacted by disease but are not typically studied in traditional randomized clinical trials (RCT) and to obtain insights from everyday care settings and real-world adherence to inform clinical practice. RWE is derived from so-called real-world data (RWD), ie, information generated by clinicians in the course of everyday patient care, and is sometimes coupled with systematic input from patients in the form of patient-reported outcomes or from wearable biosensors. Studies using RWD are conducted to evaluate how well medical interventions, services, and diagnostics perform under conditions of real-world use, and may include long-term follow-up. Here, we describe the main types of studies used to generate RWE and offer pointers for clinicians interested in study design and execution. Our tactical guidance addresses (1) opportunistic study designs, (2) considerations about representativeness of study participants, (3) expectations for transparency about data provenance, handling and quality assessments, and (4) considerations for strengthening studies using record linkage and/or randomization in pragmatic clinical trials. We also discuss likely sources of bias and suggest mitigation strategies. We see a future where clinical records - patient-generated data and other RWD - are brought together and harnessed by robust study design with efficient data capture and strong data curation. Traditional RCT will remain the mainstay of drug development, but RWE will play a growing role in clinical, regulatory, and payer decision-making. The most meaningful RWE will come from collaboration with astute clinicians with deep practice experience and questioning minds working closely with patients and researchers experienced in the development of RWE.Plain Language Summary: Diagnostics, medical interventions, and health services may not perform as well as expected when used in everyday care. The demand for real-world evidence (RWE) to support evidence-based medicine has been fueled by an explosion of accessible data from health encounters using information that clinicians record during everyday patient care, and from patients, caregivers, and biosensors worn by patients. Real-world data (RWD) is an all-encompassing term referring to data from clinical care and everyday life. RWE comes from coupling carefully curated RWD with strong study design and analytics. The primary use of RWE is to fill evidence gaps about real-world performance for people often excluded or underrepresented in clinical trials such as the elderly, those with co-morbidities, or those who use multiple medications. We provide examples of patient registries, longitudinal follow-up studies, evidence hubs with established data linkage and study-specific record linkage.This paper offers tactical advice about the value of opportunistic study designs, what to plan for in terms of transparency in data generation and management, and how pharmacy claims are being linked with electronic health records and/or patient-generated health data. We also explain that treatment decisions may be made by statistical randomization, not by doctors and patients, but after randomization, naturalistic follow-up can be used, ie systematic data collection from patients as they present for care or using decentralized processes. The most meaningful RWE will come from a collaboration of astute clinicians working with patients and researchers experienced using RWD to support evidence-based clinical practice."
