The sample includes 271 individuals from diverse organizations. Based on a survey, employees assessed their leaders’ coaching skills and reported their own happiness and turnover intention. The findings demonstrate that leaders’ coaching skills have a negative impact on employees’ turnover intention and a positive impact on their happiness, with the latter mediating the relationship between the first two variables. Organizations should note that a leader’s coaching skills are useful not only for the employee’s happiness, but also for avoiding turnover intention; therefore, organizations should encourage leaders to integrate more coaching skills into their leadership styles. The identification of an employee’s happiness as a mediator of the relationship between a leader’s coaching skills and employees’ turnover intention is an original contribution, thereby extending previous research over these topics. © 2022 by the authors.","happiness; leaders’ coaching skills; turnover intention",""

Design/methodology/approach: Literature analysis and quantitative empirical data collection are used to achieve this study's purpose. The study employed a non-experimental, cross-sectional, explanatory design. A questionnaire of closed-ended questions was used, adapted from validated scales for measuring constructs, and apply to 156 employees of industrial, service and commercial companies in the Northeast of Mexico. The analysis techniques used included exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings: In the descriptive analysis of the data, the authors find that 57.7% of the sample is satisfied with the communication climate, 28.85% moderately satisfied, and 13.47% dissatisfied. Regarding the levels of happiness at work, high (71.15%), medium (21.15%) and low (7.7%) levels were found. In intrapreneurship, high (67.31%), medium (26.92%) and low (5.77%) levels were found. The exploratory factorial analysis showed that the instrument was adequate for measuring the variables. Good correlations were also found between the items that make up each variable. Finally, the relationship between internal communication, measured by the dimensions of communicative climate and communication in meetings, and happiness at work was verified using the structural equation technique. The latter has a positive impact on intrapreneurship. Research limitations/implications: This article has some theoretical and methodological limitations like any other academic work. They would be interesting to address in future research. In this way, it is possible to empirical examine the variables of intrapreneurship, internal communication and happiness (Ravina-Ripoll et al., 2021c). The first is the study's cross-sectional design and data collection by a non-probabilistic sample, carried out in a single source. Both aspects mean that our study is not free of corresponding biases; this may result in the findings of the present work not being statistically correct. The second derives from the absence in the literature of structural equation modelling studies that analyse the constructs that make up the object of this academic work in a multidimensional way. However, although an influence I show between the variables, it is recommended to take the data with discretion. There is still a need for more empirical evidence to support these relationships before generalised results can be presumed. Despite the remarkable progress made in recent years in the literature on the three dimensions of this article, few scientific studies examine inferentially how internal communication and intra-entrepreneurship influence employees' happiness at work in today's digital society. The authors of this academic work consider it attractive for future research to address the analysis of internal communication strategic management models. It is a robust driver of intra-entrepreneurship and employee happiness in organisations (Galván-Vela et al., 2022a). In conclusion, from this heuristic perspective, companies can improve, on the one hand, their competitive position in the market. Their managers must cultivate an organisational culture that emphasises internal communication as a catalyst for innovation, employee loyalty, and productive efficiency. On the other hand, companies will be able to invigorate their corporate image to face the significant challenges in the globalised economy, thus to become sustainable, humane, ecological intra-entrepreneurial corporations (Galván-Vela et al., 2021a). It may lead to a more social, inclusive, prosperous and egalitarian ecosystem. In this way, it makes the culture of organisations around the pillars of happiness management, social marketing and the Sustainable Development Goals shine (Galván-Coronil et al., 2021). Practical implications: This section does not attempt to argue that internal communication and intrapreneurship constitute two intangible resources that improve organisations' productivity and collective happiness (Lee and Kim, 2022). However, it is necessary to clarify that the results achieved in this academic study show two fundamental aspects. The first is to invite managers of companies in the post-Covid-19 era to cultivate a culture based on happiness management. It makes internal communication a fast vehicle that exponentially boosts intrapreneurship, among other things (Castillo-Abdul et al., 2021). To this end, their strategic management models must carry out a diametrical shift in their innovation and internal communication actions. On the one hand, it allows for building loyalty among their creative talent. It does this by creating an organisational climate that encourages interpersonal relationships, the spirit of teamwork, collaborative participation, and disruptive thinking (Thelen and Formanchuk, 2022). On the other hand, promoting an ethical, assertive and empathetic leadership style proactively stimulates the commitment, trust and passion for the work of all members of the company (Men and Yue, 2019). The second is to emphasise implementing a constructive, friendly and positive intra-organisational language. In this way, it is dynamising the collective happiness of its human capital through the figure of the Chief Happiness (Jiménez-Marín et al., 2021b). Originality/value: Intrapreneurship, internal communication and happiness at work are topics of great interest in academic agendas in recent years. It is basically because these three dimensions, individually or jointly, have positive effects on the productivity of organisations. However, no research flow evidences our theoretical model proposed in this article. Therefore, there is a need for future studies that advance the literature in the area of business. In this way, we will have more data on how these constructs affect the life of organisations in the post-Covid 19 eras. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Internal communication; Intrapreneurship; Work happiness",""

This research aims to investigate the link between customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction as well as how each affects organizational success. The impact of several organizational elements on employee satisfaction is examined in this research. In this cohort study, qualitative research techniques were used. A self-administrated questionnaire with multiple choice and release ruined questions were used to gather the data. The results of the principal component analysis (PCA) based on the correlation matrix showed that among the cohorts examined, where consumers had also indicated satisfaction with the current services, there was a high level of employee (hotel staff) satisfaction. Customers' comfort and subsequent satisfaction have mostly been influenced by ambient cleanliness, wholesome meals, and hotel services. From the viewpoint of the workers, a positive work environment combined with rewards like pay and regular training motivated the staff to work devotedly to improve the organization, which is reflected in the customers' satisfaction levels. Our research supports the existence of an indirect relationship mediated by customers between organizational performance and employee happiness. In conclusion, it is plausible to assume that awareness of employee roles is crucial since it seems to be a crucial component of the success of contemporary organizations. © 2023 Malque Publishing.","customer satisfaction; employee satisfaction; job satisfaction; organizational success",""

Therefore, this study is evaluated from a marketing and managerial perspective so that companies can be more sensitive about the happiness of their employees. For this reason, it is aimed to examine the relationship between internal marketing activities and the happiness of the employees and to determine whether the working time causes a significant difference on the happiness of the employees. The research data was obtained from the employees of a maritime enterprise operating in Turkey, by means of an electronic questionnaire as a result of the convenience sampling method. As a result, in this study, internal marketing emerged as a 3-dimensional structure. It has been determined that there is a positive and significant relationship between internal marketing dimensions and employee happiness. In consequence of the regression analysis, it was determined that ""education and development"" and ""vision and communication"" dimensions had a positive effect on employee happiness, while the ""performance measurement and rewarding"" dimension did not have a significant effect.

Human engagement, and especially that of employees, has been singled out as a critical management strategy for creating this competitive edge. The fields of industrial relations and human resource management, however, have historically taken opposing stances on the importance of employees' input.The former has been steered by economic insights, while the latter is founded on employee reactions to choices made at work. Three of the most well-known ways to get workers invested in their company are via managerial or decision-making responsibilities, financial incentives, and stock holdings. 50 businesses in the NCR Reigon, India, were surveyed to see how three participation strategies affected employee happiness, productivity, and company success. 500 answers were collected from staff members regarding their involvement habits and general happiness, providing objective data for use in evaluating the organization's success. The findings demonstrated a substantial association between any type of engagement and employee well-being, even after adjusting for firm size and industry. Participation in making decisions by workers was shown to have a negative correlation with productivity on the job. Financial involvement procedures did not seem to have any correlation with the efficiency of the organisation, according to the statistical research. This study lends credence to the idea that one of the pillars of HR practises has a positive impact on employee well-being, but it does not provide conclusive evidence that employee involvement directly corresponds to better business results.Scientists and academic contributors get access to new areas of inquiry, while business leaders gain valuable insights. © 2023 IEEE.","Administrative science; AI Human Resource Management; Employee well-being; Statistical Analysis","Behavioral research; Competition; Decision making; Digital storage; Information management; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Administrative science; AI human resource management; Competitive advantage; Data driven; Employability skills; Employee well-being; Human resources management; Performance; Well being; Workers'; Human resource management"

Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with five employees as key informants of each department. Observations were carried out unstructured to collect information about key performance indicator (KPI) and their achievements. Combining the interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) and Schutz’s phenomenology, the data analysis stage includes coding (interpretation, condensation and categorization of themes) and thematic analysis. Findings: The findings show employees’ different feelings and actions in achieving their KPIs. Therefore, the anticipations of obstacles in achieving KPI were based on the intersubjective influence of personal goals, company goals, peers, bosses/departments and customers. Thus, in achieving KPI, employees strive to simultaneously achieve personal goals as well as company goals. Research limitations/implications: Previous literature on management accounting mainly focuses on organizational perspective and less on individual-centred phenomenological perspective. This study tries to fill this gap by exploring how intersubjectivity plays a role in employees’ mundane experiences.

It also analyses the mediating effect of employee happiness on the relationship between FWA and employees’ perceived productivity, OC and perceived work quality. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative, non-experimental correlational study was used for this research project. The study yielded numerical data, which were analysed using a deductive approach. The analysis aimed at exploring the relationships between the constructs, which were viewed as variables; these relationships were considered correlations, mediation and moderation. The sample comprises employees currently working at different public and private sector organisations, representing all major service industries in the UAE. Nine questions were used to assess the flexibility at work and six out of the nine questions were used to measure the level of FWAs using the Likert scale. Findings: FWA has a significant and positive association with the employees’ perceived productivity, quality of work and OC. It was confirmed that happiness plays a mediating role in the relationship between FWA and employee outcomes. The facility allows employees to manage their personal and professional lives with ease using their preferred work method. This ability promotes employee satisfaction. In conclusion, managers and employees around the world should view FWAs as a positive tool to enhance employee productivity and OC, particularly in an emergency like the Covid-19 pandemic. Research limitations/implications: The participants’ honesty was a limitation, which could raise questions on the validity of this study. This limitation arises when the self-report method is used for data collection. Use of multiple instruments could be another limitation. Practical implications: Organisational leaders can use FWAs to improve employee outcomes. When an organisation grants flexible work options to employees, it implies that the organisation trusts its employees to complete the task. This factor motivates all employees to work with dedication, which is particularly true if the employees are creative people and wish to work on their preferred time and place. Originality/value: This study is significant because the findings will allow managers to assess the benefits of using FWAs to improve employee productivity, particularly in the service sector. It combines the aspects of perceived productivity, OC and perceived work quality, as well as employee happiness to assess the role of FWAs in organisations. The study also investigates the influence of FWAs in improving these employee outcomes. Based on the literature review, this study on FWAs is the first of its kind in the UAE, the country using a truly multinational workforce coming from more than 100 countries and cultures. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Flexible work environment; Happiness; Organisational commitment; Perceived productivity; Perceived work quality; Service sector; Total quality management; UAE",""

Results: Structural equation modelling results showed that satisfaction and affective organizational commitment fully mediated the relationship between perceived manager's emotional intelligence and happiness at work. Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that perceived manager's emotional intelligence influences employee happiness through its influence on increasing or decreasing job satisfaction and affective organizational commitment. These findings therefore provide insight into employee's wellbeing and potentially how to promote it.  © 2023 Malek Bakheet ELAYAN et al., published by Sciendo.","Affective organizational commitment; Emotional intelligence; Happiness at work; Job satisfaction; Saudi educational sector",""

In the field of public relations, published studies address these benefits for individuals and collectively, both for the employees themselves (Pérez, 2020) and for the organisation for which they work, whether intangible or tangible (Castro-Martínez and Díaz-Morilla, 2020; Sidney et al., 2017). However, the function of promoting a good working environment is not always attended to in the workplace, nor is it always exclusive to a specific area (Bowen, 2008). In addition to a systematic documentary review, the Web of Science database is used for a bibliometric study and network mapping of the scientific literature, from which articles are extracted for analysis using different bibliographic searches. Based on the information obtained, VOSviewer software is used for the analysis of bibliometric networks by authorship, citation and co-occurrence of keywords in scientific publications. The number of articles published on the management of happiness and wellbeing in organisations as part of their public relations has increased significantly over the last decade, although there has been a notable change in this growth since 2021. According to the research, corporate social responsibility programmes are increasingly considering these aspects as part of their organisational strategy, and departments such as human resources are taking on a greater role in generating a good working environment. This study provides an overview of the international production of scientific publications on the subject of happiness management and organisational well-being from the point of view of public relations. It shows the evolution of scientific activity in terms of the number of works published by area of knowledge and the current trends in terms of authorship, subject matter and repercussion in the scientific field. © (2023), (Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona).

However, the extent to which these practices contribute towards employee non-green workplace outcomes remains largely unknown. This study explores the relationships among green HRM practices, happiness at work, employee resilience, and feedback-seeking behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs two-wave data from a sample of 306 five-star hotel employees in India. Using partial least square-structural equation modelling, the relationships are tested. Findings: The study’s results demonstrate that green HRM practices positively impact happiness at work, employee resilience, and feedback-seeking behaviour. Additionally, the relationship between green HRM practices and feedback-seeking behaviour and employee resilience is mediated by happiness at work. Research limitations/implications: Drawing on the Job Demands-Resources Theory, Social Exchange Theory, and Broaden and Build theory, this paper proposes that green HRM practices can contribute to happiness at work, employee resilience, and feedback-seeking behaviour. Practical implications: To establish a positive connection between green HRM practices and employee outcomes, organizations must recognize the vital role played by happiness at work as a mediator. This means that organizations must implement green HRM practices and ensure their positive impact on employee happiness at work.

The authors subdivide well-being into three components: happiness, trust and health. Design/methodology/approach: This is a cross-sectional, multisite survey study in internal service units of hospitals. Data analyzed using multivariate regression come from a sample of 1,886 survey respondents (42 units, N = 218 supervisors, N = 1,668 employees) in eight Dutch academic hospitals that have implemented LM&SS. Findings: The present study findings show no or weak effects of LM&SS on the happiness and health component of employee well-being. In addition, the authors found a significant but weak direct positive effect (ß = 0.07) of the LM&SS bundle on the trusting relationships component of well-being. Therefore, moderating effects of HRM practices on the relationship between LM&SS and employee well-being seem less relevant because an existing relationship between LM&SS and employee well-being is a prerequisite for moderation (Hayes, 2009). There were unexpected side effects. Inspired by research that discusses direct effects of HRM on employee well-being, the authors tested this relationship and found that HRM has a direct positive effect on trust and happiness of employees in health care. For the health component of well-being, the present results show a weak negative effect of HRM. Practical implications: This study results in a cautiously optimistic view about LM&SS in health care, provided that it is applied in a targeted manner (to improve the performance of their processes) and that HRM is strategically aligned with the goals of LM&SS to improve employees’ happiness and trusting relationships.

However, the blurred border between employees’ work and life can create work–life conflict (WLC) that negatively affects their well-being. Therefore, identifying factors that help employees overcome WLC and nurture their well-being is imperative. From a transformative service research (TSR) and personal psychology perspective, this study aims to explore the roles of service employee state of mindfulness and resilience in reducing WLC, alleviating its negative effects and ultimately nurturing their happiness. Design/methodology/approach: A structural model was proposed. Data were collected from 339 WFH employees in various knowledge-based services such as professional services, information, education and training, financial consulting and marketing. Direct, indirect, mediating and moderating effects were estimated using the CB-SEM method. Findings: Mindfulness is the overarching capability that helps reduce WLC and raise resilience. It nurtures WFH employee happiness not only directly but also via the mediation of resilience and WLC. Resilience, on the other hand, mediates the effect of mindfulness on happiness and moderates the negative impact of WLC on happiness. Practical implications: Firms are recommended to organize mindfulness and resilience training programs, and encourage organizational- and job-related facilitators. WFH employees should actively participate in such programs and add them to their to-do-list practices. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is among the first empirical studies of employee mindfulness and resilience in the WFH context. It contributes to the TSR research stream and enriches the concepts of mindfulness and resilience by elucidating different mechanisms in which each of these personal qualities operates to help employees nurture happiness in this specific working condition. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Happiness; Knowledge-based services; Mindfulness; Resilience; Work from home; Work–life conflict",""

Individual employee happiness has an indirect impact on the company’s bottom line (e.g., personnel turnover, restrictions on fitness-to-work, occupational injuries and diseases, labor law disputes). Workplace Health Promotion Initiatives (WHPIs) can successfully assist in addressing these labor-market difficulties. An Italian hospital has implemented a workplace strategy to improve the professional performance of healthcare personnel (HCWs). A multidisciplinary team directs WHPIs such as “Disability Management” (DM), which addresses developing impairments (e.g., chronic degenerative illnesses, oncological diseases), and “Help Point” (HP), which provides psychological support to overburdened HCWs. We provide Findings about the economic effect of these two WHPIs. From July 2017 to December 2019, 131 HCWs were enrolled in DM and 35 HCWs in HP (September 2016-June 2019). Sickness absence days (SADs) in the 12-month period preceding and after WHPIs. Return on Investment (ROI) was calculated as the ratio of net profit to investment cost for the WHPIs management using SAD reduction accounting for profit. SADs dropped by 67% and 60% for DM and HP respectively, resulting in ROIs of 27.66 and 2.73 (p values: 0.001, and 0.05). Given the limited sample sizes, the results must be interpreted with care. Because of their instructional value, WHPIs constitute a “win-win” strategy for employees, businesses, and society. Public health policies should raise worldwide knowledge of the economic benefits of investing in improving employee’s well-being for the benefit of society as a whole, toward the global horizon of occupational salutogenesis. © (2023), (European Publishing).

Based on a multi-source sample of 192 individuals in 40 teams from a large public organization in Thailand, the hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses revealed that when interpersonal justice climate was high, job satisfaction did not contribute significantly to job performance.

However, the factors that relate to employees’ satisfaction or dissatisfaction with this event, as well as to their positive and negative affect associated with this event, are currently not well understood. Accordingly, the current study aimed to explore how employee characteristics (e.g., demographics, employment characteristics, attitudes), organizational characteristics (i.e., human relations, open systems, rational goal, internal process culture), and event characteristics (e.g., location, activities, heavy drinking, inappropriate behavior of supervisors or colleagues, ritual features) are related to employee happiness. Data were provided by 359 employees from various organizations in Germany, who completed an online survey at the beginning of January 2019. Results showed that a human relations culture, an external location, fun activities, informality, and symbolism predicted higher employee satisfaction with the Christmas party. In contrast, heavy drinking and formality predicted higher dissatisfaction with the Christmas party, and longer organizational tenure, a human relations culture, a speech, providing both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, and symbolism predicted lower dissatisfaction. Furthermore, employee age, organizational identification, involvement in planning, a human relations and an internal process culture, a speech, providing both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, heavy drinking, supervisor and coworker inappropriate behavior, formality, and symbolism were differentially associated with high- and low-arousal positive and negative affect.

Utilizing a mediation mechanism, the study additionally uncovers the mediating impact of Workplace Inclusion (WI). Design/methodology/approach: The research involved a cross-sectional study with a quantitative methodology, collecting data from 311 employees working in IT sector firms in India by administering standardized questionnaires. Statistical analyses, including Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling using SmartPLS4.0, were conducted to examine the relationship between constructs. Findings: The hypothesized mediation model was supported. WI mediated the relationship partially between OJ and HAW, whereas there is a full mediating effect of WI on the IL–HAW relationship. Overall, the study shows that by providing fair treatment, inclusive leaders promote inclusivity among employees, further enhancing HAW. Research limitations/implications: The study’s implications suggest that leaders, with their inclusive behaviour and fair practices, can have a significant positive impact on employees’ workplace happiness when accompanied by a sense of inclusivity among employees. Practical implications: Organizations and leaders can utilize this study’s findings to promote inclusiveness and HAW, which can be a key to organizational growth and development in a post-pandemic era.

Specifically, three factors are proposed as determinants of transcendence happiness (THP): corporate culture (CO), internal communication (IC), and employee-centered personnel management (EPM). To this end, a model proposes to help guide employees in the tourism industry toward happiness. From a sample of 443 employees in tourist accommodations in Spain, we explore the feasibility of an SEM-PLS model based on already validated scales. Our results show, on the one hand, the critical role of organisational culture in the pursuit of employee happiness and, on the other hand, the mediating effect of internal communication between personnel management and transcendent happiness. This ground-breaking study fills two gaps in the current happiness management literature. The first is considering transcendent happiness as an innovative key to corporate governance. It requires a corporate culture that fosters all human capital’s personal growth and work-related well-being. In addition, secondly, to demonstrate that the variables of internal communication and passion at work positively influence the transcendental happiness of internal customers in rural establishments. Between internal communication and personnel management based on the employee’s growth, the organisational culture has the most significant impact not only on personnel management but also on the achievement of the happiness of private employees. To this end, rural accommodations should design organisational patterns based on codes of conduct in the social relations between employees and managers. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","",""

However, COVID-19 stress in the current situation is a major problem for employees and it can negatively influence their happiness level. Therefore, it is critical to understand how the stressful nature of the current pandemic threatens workplace happiness. Based on conservation of resources theory (Hobfoll, 1989), this study aims to examine the resources to be protected (i.e. psychological capital) and resource investment (i.e. coping) to ensure the happiness of the employees amidst a bio-psycho-socioeconomic crisis like COVID-19 pandemic. The study explores the mediating role of psychological capital and the moderating effect of coping on the relationship between COVID-19 stress and employee happiness. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from the Indian working population by means of purposive sampling (N = 336). Standardized instruments were used to measure the variables under study. Data analysis were done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences 20.0 and Analysis of Moment Structure 20.0 software tools and PROCESS macro was used for mediation and moderation analysis. Findings: Structural equation modelling analysis showed that COVID-19 stress negatively influenced employee happiness; whereas psychological capital partially mediated the relationship between these two variables. Further, coping was found to buffer against the harmful implications of COVID-19 stress on employee happiness. Originality/value: In an effort to respond timely to the present pandemic scenario, the current study provides an account of the harmful effects of COVID-19-related stress on the workplace happiness of the Indian service sector employees.

In this study, which aims to reveal the harmful effects of overdose of employee happiness, the reasons for the manager’s fear - or anxiety - about the happiness of his employees are interpreted. The Inverted-U Model of Employee Happiness (IUMEH) has been developed and individual work outputs have been evaluated in three areas that (1) support happiness, (2) reflect balanced happiness, and (3) turn negative with an overdose of happiness intoxication. It has been suggested that IUMEH, which is thought to contribute to the literature as it is the first descriptive model to emerge, should be supported by applied studies, and it has been reminded that the curvilinear aspect of the model may include differences in terms of culture, type and characteristics of job, private, public or non-profit enterprises, generations of managers and the level of managers (front-line, middle level and senior level etc.).

Informed by our fictions and their analysis, we offer three main takeaways. First, designers can intentionally foster happiness by incorporating happiness-fostering strategies in technology design.

In today's world, every organization operates in a changing context. Change has been described in management and related disciplines as a ""constant"" since it is always present. It has to be managed strategically in order for management to take responsibility for the future of the organization. A strategic orientation is futuristic and there is wide consensus that management of change requires strategic leadership for success in the turbulent business environment of today. Strategic change includes all the efforts and actions that the Top Management Team (TMT) implements in order to move an organization from its present state toward the desired future state. This future state is usually captured in an organization's vision or simply the mental picture of where it wishes to be in future when performing at its best. Today the world of work is facing unprecedented changes that require implementation of strategic changes particularly in the workspace. These changes have been brought about by a multiplicity of factors, including COVID-19 and other highly infectious diseases such as Bird flu and Ebola; ICT; climate change; globalization and many other factors. The changes have challenged organizations in terms of critical aspects such as employees' happiness at work, engagement, wellness, and growth. Generally, the overall result of the changes in the workspace is lack of fulfillment at work and the consequent impediment to employee commitment, engagement, wellness, and growth. These engender the need for strategic interventions to engage and include employees more, improve their wellness, and growth among other benefits. This chapter presents the key ideas of the theory of strategic change, wellness, and growth, and how strategic change can be implemented toward engagement, inclusion, wellness, and growth.

They promote employee happiness and retention, improve team performance, and enhance talent while effective leadership enables engineering managers to capture the full potential of employees' skills and knowledge. Previous research demonstrates that happier employees are more engaged and productive. This article proposes a conceptual model of culture from the perspective of organizational leadership theory. In particular, the model is derived from a longitudinal study of complexity leadership and represents culture at three scales: societal (macro), organizational (meso), and team (micro). At each level, culture is conceived as a set of actively promoted or discouraged behaviors, what might be called active culture. We also propose that employee happiness is largely influenced by the form and interplay of leadership and these layered cultures. Our aim is to provide practical implications for engineering managers wanting to develop business or team culture, leadership, and employee happiness while seeking to promote productivity and engagement.  © 1973-2011 IEEE.","Active culture; business culture; complexity; employee happiness; leadership; societal culture; team culture","Computational complexity; Human resource management; Active culture; Behavioral science; Business culture; Complexity; Complexity theory; Cultural difference; Employee happiness; Leadership; Pragmatic; Societal culture; Team culture; Behavioral research"

The research hypotheses were tested using Covariance-Based Structural Equation Modeling (CB-SEM). Findings: The analysis results show that POS is positively related to employee happiness and job dedication. Job stress is negatively related to employee happiness but positively related to job dedication. Job dedication partially mediates the relationships between job stress and happiness, and POS and happiness.

Together with qualitative and quantitative research methods, future research could be conducted on the predecessors of job dedication and comparatively on employee happiness for different country samples. Practical implications: In order to increase employee happiness, Turkish hotel managers may want to increase POS and decrease perceived job stress of their employees. Although it was found out in this study that job stress increases job dedication, it is also accepted that this unexpected situation arises due to special conditions. Therefore, by reducing job stress, hotel managers may prefer to increase the job dedication of their employees and their happiness indirectly.

We propose that employees can make more substantial agentic changes to their work experiences if they also hold growth mindsets about their job designs. We introduce the concept of dual-growth mindset—viewing both the self and job as malleable—and examine its impact on employee happiness over time. We hypothesize that fostering a dual-growth mindset yields relatively durable gains in happiness, while fostering a growth mindset about either the self or job is insufficient for sustainable increases in happiness. We tested these predictions using two experimental studies: a field quasi-experiment in a Fortune 500 technology company and a controlled experiment with employees in a variety of organizations and occupations. Across the two experiments, fostering dual-growth mindset yielded gains in self-reported and observer-rated happiness that lasted at least 6 months. Fostering growth mindsets about either the self or job alone did not generate lasting increases in happiness. Supplementary mediation analyses suggest dualgrowth mindsets boosted happiness by enabling employees to plan more substantial job crafting. Our research suggests that durable gains in happiness at work depend on holding flexible mindsets about the job, not only the self. © 2022 American Psychological Association","Agency; Experiments; Growth mindset; Happiness; Job crafting","Happiness; Humans; Occupations; Self Report; article; controlled study; employee; experimental study; happiness; human; mediation analysis; occupation; organization; prediction; occupation; self report"

However, relevant studies have focused only on the negative interpersonal antecedents of knowledge hiding but neglected the inhibition effect of positive informal relationships on the behavior. To fill this gap, the current study develops a moderated mediation model to investigate how and when workplace friendship has a negative impact on knowledge hiding. Drawing on social exchange theory (SET), we propose that workplace friendship inhibits knowledge hiding through the mediating role of employee well-being, with the Perception of Chaxu climate acting as a boundary condition. Using data from a two-wave time-lagged survey of 279 employees in China, the results show that workplace friendship has a negative impact on knowledge hiding behavior. Specifically, workplace friendship inhibits knowledge hiding by satisfied employee well-being, i.e., workplace friendship has a positive impact on employee well-being, while employee well-being has a negative impact on knowledge hiding. Perception of Chaxu Climate moderates the indirect effect, as the level of employee’s Perception of Chaxu climate rises, the direct effect of workplace friendship on employee well-being is stronger, so as the indirect effect of workplace friendship on knowledge hiding. This article explores the mechanisms affecting employee knowledge hiding from a new interpersonal perspective of workplace friendship.

It not only inspires employees but also increases an organization's production. Performance assessment is regarded as a critical tool and is used in virtually all types of organizations, with a few exceptions. Performance assessment systems have integrated new values and desirable behaviors in an attempt to influence the actions and attitudes of employees in businesses. Organizations have been more eager in recent years to improve the performance of their personnel. The chapter's aim is to discover the performance assessment method used in businesses and its impact on employee competencies and efficiency. It focuses on the issues and repercussions that companies confront, as well as the best practices implemented for effective implementation. Using data from 150 workers and regression research, we will evaluate and investigate the relationship between employee happiness and maximizing company performance with or without the level of supervising employee as a moderating variable. We discovered that quality connection supervisor employee plays an important function and can improve job happiness. This research also makes recommendations for strengthening the connection between the supervisor and the employee, as well as the efficacy of performance assessment in a company. Finally, this paper study will make recommendations on how to enhance supervisor-employee relationships in order to boost the degree of work satisfaction among employees in a government organization. © 2024 Author(s).","Employee; Job Satisfaction; Organization; Performance Appraisal; Relation",""

This study takes an inquisitive trip to the interface between human resources and machine learning, investigating the empirical discoveries and practical applications that reframe HRMI. We explore the complex relationship between HR choices and outcomes like performance and turnover using machine learning models. A convincing narrative is articulated by the study's authors: machine learning methods, ranging from linear regression to random forests, lead a data-driven HR revolution. The results highlight the value of strategic investment in employee development, provide light on the complex dynamics of employee happiness and retention, and explore the ethical elements of HRMI in an age of heightened data scrutiny. Real-world examples illustrate the concepts and provide actionable guidance for HR experts who want to make more informed decisions with the help of data. This study also supports a more comprehensive method of HRMI, one that integrates empirical data analysis with theoretical frameworks. The convergence of AI, ethical AI, and the changing nature of remote labor opens up exciting possibilities for HRMI in the future. This waypoints towards an HRMI field that is not just reactive but also prescient, an area where information serves as the compass leading businesses to improved financial health, more diversity of thought, and a more promising future in the workplace.

Happiness in the workplace is a combination of several factors like engagement, empowerment, wellbeing, and culture. Increasingly, forward-thinking companies understand that employee happiness translates into positive business results and has an impact on business profitability. Such organisations put employees ahead of customers as they recognise that a happy and motivated employee will treat the customer in the best possible way, thus creating long-term profitability and value for the business. Happy and engaged workplaces have a positive influence on employees and empower them. Happy employees are productive and satisfied and are proactively responsible and accountable for not only their own success but that of the organisation. Happiness in the workplace is not a quick fix, and one-off initiatives could fail to create sustained happiness. Creating sustained happiness within the workplace requires creating a work culture and environment that nurtures employees. Embedding happiness within the workplace and making it quantifiable and practical requires putting together the right policies, processes, and measurements to create a workplace that has a positive vibe and employees are motivated to give their best to the organisation every day. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.

This paper, therefore, aims to detail the strategic benefits of happiness initiatives along with the expected business benefits on long-term basis. A happy employee is defined as a productive and loyal employee. When an employee is happy, they tend to display greater engagement with their job. Similarly, studies have shown that when an individual feels ""heard"" and that their voice matters, their levels of morale are higher. Moreover, when equipped with the right tools to cope with a stressful environment, a worker's level of productivity and the quality of their work improves. The data collected at the end of each initiative is an important reference and resource for companies with a high number of employees across various specialties. This paper will provide the background of the importance of happiness initiatives, as well as making the first steps towards cultivating a culture of happiness in the more traditional industries, especially including the oil, gas and energy industry. The concept of a happiness initiative, especially in relation to international best practices, is currently not widely applied in traditional industries with evidence on the lack of a true sense of happy and productive engagement across different employees'levels and contractors. Elevating happiness across organizations is, therefore, essential, as indicated by the fact that good mental health and well-being are core needs for any business to succeed in the post-COVID-19 era. Happiness at work is a relative, attainable concept that can be fostered and sustained in a more professional context, where organizations can play a vital and critical role in the research, establishment, and advancement of workplace happiness policies and frameworks on strategic basis that will positively result in tangible and non-tangible business benefits. This paper will outline mechanisms, best practices and the role of ""Chief Happiness Officers"" in leading tailor-made happiness initiatives to address organizational-specific needs and emerging issues.

Objective: This paper presents the descriptive data of organizational factors that contribute to staff happiness in one of the Malaysian Technical University Network (MTUN) clusters in Malaysia. Methods: This study was conducted at one of the Malaysian Technical University Network (MTUN) clusters in Malaysia. It involved 20 respondents comprising academicians who had served more than 11 years. The session at the Round Table Discussion was organized to discuss the issues that were highlighted in the survey data. Results and Conclusion: Analysis showed that the personal economy and personal appreciation dimension were among the highest contributors in determining employee happiness, followed by a support system, workstation environment, and trust. Furthermore, the discussion is related to the general aspect of Perceived Organizational Support Theory which supports the data analysis on individual happiness aspect in the institution of higher education. Originality/Value: By emphasizing the role of factors such as support systems, workstation environment, and trust in determining employee happiness, the study provides valuable insights into the broader dynamics of the workplace. Understanding how these factors influence employee satisfaction can inform strategies for improving organizational culture and employee engagement.

It also assesses whether prosocial motivation strengthens the influence of job contact on innovative work behavior (via happiness at work). Design/methodology/approach: The model was examined on a sample of 180 employee-supervisor dyads (90 supervisors and 180 employees) recruited from various government departments in the United Arab Emirates. Findings: The findings support the proposed moderated mediation model in which job contact positively and significantly impacts innovative work behavior. The association between job contact and innovative behavior via happiness at work is found to be stronger for employees who are highly prosocially motivated.

Findings: The finding confirms that CrM does indeed have an effect on employee happiness, especially if employee's cause involvement in the CrM is evident. The result suggested that CrM initiatives should be promoted together with employee's cause involvement with the program because this will increase the general level of HaW in the organization.

This study creates an integrated HPWS-Employee Happiness interaction model using the constructs of HPWS, Work Intensification (WI), Employees Happiness (EH), and Organizational Growth (OG), which will provide forecasting for the future research paths of HPWS. To advance the idea of HPWS, its relationship with employees, and its connection with organizations, this study examines the literature and incorporates 70 papers published between 2000 and 2023 from various sources. An HPWS-Employee Happiness interaction model has been developed based on the ability, motivation, and opportunity (AMO) framework and literature review of how the HPWS environment affects job intensification and employee happiness. In the future, we will test the model empirically to confirm the study’s results. The HPWS-employee interaction model will concentrate on creating HR tactics businesses can use to increase performance and employee engagement. It will assist us in identifying HPWS-related possibilities, challenges, and solutions.

As part of this research, the authors examine the interplay between “hard” and “soft” practices for LM&SS and “soft” HR practices. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional, multisite survey study covering all internal service units at all eight Dutch university hospitals was conducted (42 units, N = 218 supervisors, N = 1,668 employees), and multivariate multilevel regression analyses were performed. Findings: A systems approach involving “soft” LM&SS practices that are specifically HR-related has a positive effect (β is 0.46) on a climate for LM&SS. A climate for LM&SS is not related to perceived performance or employee health. It is, however, positively related to employee happiness and trusting relationships (both βs are 0.33). We did not find that a climate for LM&SS had a mediating effect. Research limitations/implications: This study shows that a balanced approach involving both “hard” and “soft” factors is crucial to achieving the desired breadth and depth of LM&SS adoption at the macro, meso, and micro levels. The authors found that a climate for LM&SS positively affects employee well-being in hospitals. Practical implications: In their attempt to create mutual gains for both their organization and their employees, hospitals that adopt LM&SS should foster a climate for LM&SS by embracing a balanced approach consisting of both “hard” and “soft” practices, thereby internalizing LM&SS at the macro, meso, and micro levels.

The purpose of this study is to explore employee-centric CSR initiatives with the aim of identifying the elements stimulating happiness at work (HAW). To accomplish this, we adopt a non-linear and data-driven approach to analyze self-reported data from 441 employees across 21 small and medium-sized enterprises spanning various industries. The analysis brings to light 5 E(lements) of employee-centric CSR: envisioning, related to personal and organizational value orientation; equity, related to definition and distribution of rewards; empowerment, related to career development and professional growth; experimentation, related to innovative tasks and organizational forms; and empathy, related to a supportive workplace and coworkers' network. These 5 E(lements) serve as stimuli for HAW in different ways: envisioning, empowerment, and experimentation play a major role in promoting employees' happiness and underscore the importance of initiatives related to shared values, inclusivity, and innovative work practices. Thus, this study sheds light on the influence of employee-centric CSR in promoting HAW and on effective strategies that may contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goals targets. © 2023 The Authors.

OBJECTIVES: This research examines the employee-centered aspect among AL, trust, happiness at work and individual performance through a sequential mediating approach. METHOD: Data was collected from 435 healthcare professionals working in various hospitals in Pakistan. AL-independent variables were measured and the trust mediating variables were assessed through a questionnaire. The level of happiness at work and IP-dependent variables were measured through a survey. RESULTS: The results revealed a significant and positive effect of AL on the individual performance that is connected both directly and indirectly through mediating effects of trust and happiness at work. Furthermore, the results showed that AL created a trustworthy atmosphere among the workers that enhanced employee's happiness at work and, subsequently, improved their job performance and motivation. CONCLUSION: This research delivers new and important results as, one the one hand, it depends on the sequential mediating effects of constructs whereas, on the other hand, it integrates four important variables in one model.

To help them evolve and create positive workplaces, this study aims to extrapolate the associations between job crafting, mental toughness and authentic happiness (AH) among millennials and derive implications. Design/methodology/approach: Data was collected from 496 millennial employees at Time-1 (March 2018), Time-2 (November 2018) and Time-3 (August 2019) from multiple sectors. A combined structural equation modelling and artificial neural networks approach was implied to test the strength of the proposed associations. Findings: With reference to the relationships thus obtained between job crafting, mental toughness and AH, the results specifically conclude that challenging job demand is significant predictor of AH. Mental toughness partially mediates the relationship between challenging job demands and AH, indicating that mental toughness is an essential component for employee happiness. Practical implications: Millennial managers and policymakers must challenge the skills of employees for obtaining optimal performance. When employees perceive adequate workload and have a set deadline for the completion of tasks assigned to them, they carry out the tasks with greater efficacy, in turn, leading them to find greater meaning (focusing on essential tasks), purpose and engagement in life (enthusiastic, interested, engaged). Overall, when millennial managers focus on such associations, they can help enhance productivity and constitute happier workplaces. Originality/value: This study explores constructs such as mental toughness to support the job crafting and happiness relationship.

In this context, current research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of job satisfaction among employees of higher education institutes by implementing Total Quality Management (TQM) practices. Higher education institutions (HEIs) work in an increasingly complicated and challenging environment.

The result indicates that accepting quality management, on the other hand, offers the advantage of increasing employees' happiness and more significant learning and service quality. Furthermore, findings indicate that TQM approaches like reward and recognition, employee empowerment, training and education, quality culture, and connection and cooperation all benefit employee job satisfaction. The findings indicate that TQM is a philosophy of continuous improvement that may give a set of skills and scientific instruments to meet any educational institution's current and future requirements and expectations. © 2023 Qazvin Islamic Azad University.

This can be explained in part by a related shift toward materialist goal aspirations. Goal Contents Theory (GCT) suggests that not all goals are created equal: intrinsic goal orientations are more strongly related to subjective well-being, for example. Using one of the most comprehensive surveys of Asia ever conducted, the current study examines the central tenets of GCT in several ways. Results show intrinsic (i.e., health, safety and security, affiliation, community feeling, self-acceptance and growth) relative to extrinsic goal orientation (i.e., money and materialism) is more strongly related to higher levels of satisfaction with one’s income, job, life, and accomplishments. Additionally, results of linear and nonlinear modeling display the diminishing marginal utility of income (the most widely utilized extrinsic incentive) on satisfaction. This curvilinear effect is exacerbated by extrinsic orientation. Finally, Multilevel Item Response Theory (MIRT) analysis confirmed a hierarchical ordering of intrinsic need strength and displayed the positive effect of national human development (i.e., Human Development Index) on individual intrinsic goal orientation.

Research has explored which initiatives are effective in promoting employee happiness, the extent to which happiness affects employee performance, and the importance of numerical evidence in this regard. Studies have found a positive correlation between employee happiness and organizational performance, making employee happiness rate a crucial indicator for measuring the health and sustainability of an organization. The aim of this research was to examine the connection between performance scores and happiness, drawing on Fisher's “happy-super worker” hypothesis proposed in 1980. Data analysis was conducted on seven quarters (21 months) of information from 4,277 employees, and the results confirmed that happiness and performance are positively correlated. The study revealed that happiness had a beneficial impact on performance at both low- and high-performance score levels, albeit with a gradual effect. In contrast, happiness had a more rapid impact on success at medium-performance levels. However, a positive association was found between happiness and success across all performance scores, including low, medium, and high performance. The study revealed a curvilinear relationship between happiness and performance. Furthermore, panel data modeling showed that an increase of 1 unit in individual happiness at any given time led to an average increase of 3.41 units in their performance score. © 2023 The Authors","Correlation; Employee performance; Happiness; Panel data; Random coefficient models; Sustainable organizational strategies",""

Drawing on the social exchange theory (SET), this study examined the relationships among discretionary human resource (HR) practices, perceived organizational support (POS), meaning of work (MOW) and HAW. Design/methodology/approach: A three-path mediation model was developed to test the proposed relationships. The data were collected from Pakistani business professionals (n = 361), and hypotheses were tested using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. Findings: The results suggest that POS mediates the relationship between discretionary HR practices and HAW. Also, MOW mediated the relationship between discretionary HR practices and HAW. Hence, both POS and MOW were found to be independent mediators. Further, the data provided support for the serial mediation of POS and MOW in the relationship between discretionary HR practices and HAW. Practical implications: This research provides insights to organizations and their management on how discretionary HR practices can enhance employees’ POS, MOW and HAW. Originality/value: The findings show that discretionary HR practices are associated with employees’ HAW. In addition, two mediators (POS and MOW) were found to serially mediate the aforesaid relationships.

Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts an employee perspective since the perception of employees is the unit of analysis. By relying on a sample of 921 workers of firms from different sectors and sizes headquartered in Spain, the empirical analysis is performed using partial least squares. Findings: The findings evidence that clan and adhocracy cultures highly foster internal CSR practices and that internal CSR activities enhance employees' happiness. The mediating role of internal CSR in the relationship between organizational culture and employee happiness is also found. These results suggest that managers could play a proactive role in fostering internal CSR by designing the organizational culture according to features of clan and adhocracy cultures such as flexibility, innovation, creativity, autonomy, communication, training and support of supervisors. Research limitations/implications: The research focuses on a single country, which makes it difficult to generalize the results and guides future research into cross-cultural analysis. Including countries that present differences in their cultural and institutional context would allow to explore the influence of the national context on the business culture, on internal CSR and on employee happiness. This work is also limited in time, as the data used are of a cross-cultural nature. Practical implications: A greater effort in internal CSR by companies translates into a higher level of happiness for their workers. Specifically, occupational health and safety practices have the greatest influence on employee happiness. Hence, organizations must develop cultures that contribute to promote internal CSR—adhocracy and clan—since this would enhance employees' happiness if the values and beliefs that characterize these cultural configurations are translated into internal CSR practices such as occupational health and safety, work–life balance and equal opportunities. Social implications: The improvement of employee happiness creates social value and can be enhanced through an organizational culture that promotes CSR. The research findings might be useful when defining institutional policies to promote job quality, as encouraged by the social policy agenda of the United Nations embodied in the Sustainable Development Goals. Originality/value: Promoting internal CSR through organizational culture will have positive effects for companies internally by enhancing employees' happiness. Therefore, the article contributes to overcome the lack of evidence about the antecedents of internal CSR and its relationship with employees' happiness, an emerging variable in the management literature. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Employee happiness; Institutional theory; Internal CSR; Organizational culture; PLS",""

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of perceived organizational support (POS) and psychological capital (PsyCap) on happiness in employees’ work (i.e. work engagement), careers (i.e. career satisfaction), and lives (i.e. subjective well-being (SWB)). Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 550 employees in a conglomerate in South Korea. For statistical analysis, we conducted confirmatory factor analysis, reliability and correlation analysis, and structural equation modeling analyses. Findings: Employees were highly engaged in their work, satisfied with their careers, and felt a greater sense of well-being in their lives when they had higher POS and PsyCap. Work engagement fully mediated the relationship between PsyCap and career satisfaction. POS had an indirect effect on SWB through career satisfaction. With regards to the relationships among the three outcome variables, career satisfaction turned out to fully mediate the relationship between work engagement and SWB. In addition, the direct effect of PsyCap on SWB was also found to be significant. Research limitations/implications: This study focused on knowledge workers in South Korean for-profit firms. The participants were mostly male, junior or middle managers. Using a cross-sectional survey method, this empirical study leaves room for speculation about the causality among the variables. As the results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicate, however, common method variance was found to not be of great concern. Practical implications: The mission of human resources (HR) and organization development (OD) professionals in organizations is to improve individual and organizational performance and to enhance employees’ well-being. HR/OD professionals can enhance employees’ happiness not only in their work and careers but also in their lives by improving POS (e.g. growth opportunity, performance management, and compensation system) and developing PsyCap (e.g. staffing, training, and development, etc.). Originality/value: This study linked the emerging constructs in positive psychology in general, in HR/OB in particular. To date, no study has empirically investigated the effects of PsyCap and POS on the three workplace happiness constructs: work engagement, career satisfaction, and SWB. This is the first study that found the relationship between POS and PsyCap. Last, while South Koreans are more collectivistic and less satisfied with their lives than the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average, the respondents in this study, working for highly reputable firms, perceived high level of happiness in their work and career, and eventually in their lives. Thus, organizational features had a stronger effect on workplace happiness than national culture. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Career satisfaction; Engagement; Perceived organizational support; Psychological capital; Well-being",""

Previous studies have supported the detrimental effect of job insecurity on employees; however, the focus on happiness at work is still missing, despite the notion that a happy employee is essentially contributing to sustainable business performance. Trying to narrow the gap, the paper aims at revealing the linkage between job insecurity and happiness at work and its dimensions, namely job satisfaction, affective organisational commitment, and work engagement. Building on the hindrance stressor dimension of the stress model, and conservation of resources and psychological contract theories, the paper claims that a negative relationship exists between the constructs. Quantitative data were collected in a survey of robotised production line operators working in the furniture sector in Lithuania. As predicted, the results revealed that job insecurity had a negative impact on happiness at work as a higher-order construct and all of its dimensions. This finding should be taken seriously by organisations creating a robotised production environment while striving for sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

Equally as problematic, past investigations have primarily utilized other positive emotion variables as a proxy for happiness, thus convoluting the relationships between happiness and work outcomes. As such, taking a scientist-practitioner approach, the present study sought to address the need to: (a) directly measure employees’ happiness, (b) link employee happiness to outcomes of organizational interest, and (c) assess the impact that organizational psychosocial factors have in decreasing employee happiness levels. Therefore, by measuring employee happiness, job demands, and organizational outcomes through a two-wave full panel design, the present study provided evidence for employee happiness’s ability to significantly mediate the relationship between job demands and organizational outcomes. Explicitly, a high level of job demands decreased employee happiness, which subsequently decreased employees’ organizational commitment, task performance, and contextual performance, while increasing turnover intentions and counterproductive work behaviors. These results carry significant theoretical and practical implications. Future QOL (Quality of Life) and organizational research would benefit from building on the present findings and establishing a nomological net of employee happiness. Additionally, practitioners have the opportunity to utilize this evidence to demonstrate the impact that employee happiness has on organizationally-relevant outcomes and the role that organizations can have in fostering employee happiness. © 2020, The International Society for Quality-of-Life Studies (ISQOLS) and Springer Nature B.V.","Employees; Happiness; Happy; Job demands; Job performance",""

Self-compassion has garnered recent attention due to its positive association with well-being and happiness. Discovering novel pathways to increase the well-being of healthcare workers is essential. Objective This study sought to explore the influence of self-compassion on employee happiness in healthcare professionals. Design, Setting, and Participants A total of 400 participants (mean age = 45 ± 14, 65% female) healthcare workers at a large teaching hospital were randomly asked to complete questionnaires assessing their levels of happiness and self-compassion, life conditions, and habits. Measures Participants completed the Happiness Scale and Self-Compassion Scales, the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire as well as variables associated with well-being: relationship status, the number of hours spent exercising a week, attendance at a wellness facility, and engagement in a regular spiritual practice. Results Self-compassion was significantly and independently associated with perceived happiness explaining 39% of its variance after adjusting for age, marital status, gender, time spent exercising, and attendance to an exercise facility. Two specific subdomains of self-compassion from the instrument used, coping with isolation and mindfulness, accounted for 95% of the self-compassion effect on happiness. Conclusion Self-compassion is meaningfully and independently associated with happiness and well-being in healthcare professionals. Our results may have practical implications by providing specific self-compassion components to be targeted in future programs aimed at enhancing well-being in healthcare professionals. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","happiness; healthcare workers; job stress; mindfulness; self-compassion","Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Emotions; Empathy; Exercise; Female; Happiness; Health Personnel; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mindfulness; Self Concept; Spirituality; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; Article; awareness; exercise; female; habit; happiness; health personnel attitude; human; male; middle aged; mindfulness; priority journal; psychological well-being; questionnaire; religion; self compassion; teaching hospital; coping behavior; emotion; empathy; health care personnel; mindfulness; psychology; self concept; statistics and numerical data"

The authors contribute to this literature by using two data sets to establish the relationship between share prices on the one hand and worker wellbeing on the other. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors use over 20 years of British panel data to show that employee happiness and job satisfaction moves with share prices among those whose pay is partly determined by company fortunes. The authors then examine share price movements and employee stock holding in a single corporation and provide suggestive evidence that an increase in the firm’s stock price increases the well-being of those who belong to its employee share purchase plan (ESPP). These effects are greatest among those making the largest monthly contributions to the program who have the most to gain (or lose) from stock price fluctuations. There is also tentative evidence that the well-being effects of a higher share price are larger for those who hold more shares. Taken together these results suggest that, although stock price movements have little effect on well-being in the population at large, the well-being of those holding stock in their own company rises when the price of that stock is higher, suggesting the effects of share prices work at least partly via changes in wealth. Findings: Taken together these results suggest that the wellbeing effects of share prices work at least partly via changes in wealth. Research limitations/implications: The authors cannot be certain that the job satisfaction movements they see are causally linked to share plan participation and bonus receipt. Future research might fruitfully examine the mechanisms at play, and whether the effects identified here are linked to differences in employee motivation and effort over the business cycle. Practical implications: Firms may wish to consider the appropriateness of linking their workers’ pay to firm performance through share plans or profit shares to establish whether this improves worker wellbeing. Social implications: The utility of workers may increase where firms offer some compensation via a share plan or profit share. Originality/value: The literature suggests a link between share price movements and worker wellbeing, but the reasons for the link are contested. Using two very different data sources, the authors are able to show that share price increases induce higher worker wellbeing, at least in part, through wealth effects. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Job satisfaction; Profit sharing; Share prices; Worker wellbeing",""

The study analyzes data from Janfusan Fancyworld, the largest (in revenues and number of employees) tourism business group in Taiwan; Janfusan Fancyworld includes tourist hotels, amusement parks, restaurants and additional firms in related service sectors. The findings support the four principles of configural analysis and theory construction: recognize equifinality of different solutions for the same outcome; test for asymmetric solutions; test for causal asymmetric outcomes for very high versus very low happiness and work performance; and embrace complexity. Additional research in other firms and additional countries is necessary to confirm the usefulness of examining algorithms for predicting very high (low) happiness and very high (low) quality of work performance. The implications are substantial that configural theory and research will resolve perplexing happiness-performance conundrums. The study provides algorithms involving employees' demographic characteristics and their assessments of work facet-specifics which are useful for explaining very high happiness-at-work and high quality-of-work performance (as assessed by managers)-as well as algorithms explaining very low happiness and very low quality-of-work performance.

Most developing countries focus the fight against corruption on the deterrence perspective, which emphasizes the promptness and severity of punishment as a way of preventing and discouraging corrupt behaviors. Punishment may not adequately deter corruption, especially when employees are less satisfied with life or feel unjustly treated and may, therefore, engage in corruption as a justice-restoring act. This study, therefore, adopted a justice-focused approach to investigate the extent to which perception of organizational injustice and life satisfaction correlated with corrupt tendencies in public sector employees. The participants were 285 public sector employees (188 males; 97 females), whose ages averaged 39.09 years (SD = 8.40) with a range of 20 to 58 years. They were selected across large sections of two public sector organizations in Nigeria. Results of the 3-step hierarchical regression showed that perception of organizational injustice was significantly related with increased level of corrupt tendencies. As the participants’ level of life satisfaction increased, their tendencies of engaging in corruption reduced. Results of the mediation tests showed that, despite an increased perception of organizational injustice, life satisfaction was significantly related with low tendencies of engaging in corruption among employees. In order to reduce corrupt tendencies, organizations should efficiently handle perceived wrongdoing among employees and institute programmes that promote employees’ happiness and well-being. © 2019 West University of Timisoara Publishing House & The Euroregional Center for Applied Psychology.","Corruption; Injustice; Life satisfaction; Nigeria; Public sector",""

The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach – Using the critical incident technique, this study explores the effects of managerial communication practices on employees’ happiness, job performance, commitment, absenteeism, and turnover intentions. Totally, 101 employees in three manufacturing organisations in eastern India narrated critical incidents related to happiness and superior performance, unhappiness and inferior performance, absenteeism, and the desire to stay or quit. The incidents were further content-analysed. Findings – Results revealed that collaborative approach, respect and recognition, flexible working arrangements, trust, clear direction, autonomous and challenging tasks are important indicators to make employees happy and drive them towards superior performance. Contrarily, the dominant nature of the superior and more bossism than required, humiliation, biased approach, and lack of flexible working arrangements are detrimental to employees’ performance. Collaborative approach, respect/recognition, person-job match, autonomous and challenging tasks, flexible working arrangements, brand image, and location near hometown are the propellers for continuing service in organisations. Contrarily, hierarchical/dominant approach, humiliation, lack of respect and recognition, biased approach – different rules for different people, monotonous and boring assignments, and uncompetitive pay are the propellers for not continuing service in organisations. Humiliation, lack of flexible arrangements, and overwork are the causes for employees’ absenteeism. Research limitations/implications – This study is not without limitations. First, there were some critical incidents with apparent overlapping content areas. To overcome this situation, the authors decided to give preference to the primary theme emerging out of an incident. Second, the observations made in this study were limited to descriptions of what happened in only three organisations. This limits the ability to generalise the results. Practical implications – Organisations can train supervisors to develop people-centric communication practices, communicate with respect and recognition, implement flexible working arrangements, improve job design, involve employees in important decisions, offer them with autonomous and challenging tasks, so that employees realise their full potential and become happy contributors to their organisations. Originality/value – The study attempted to capture employees’ lived experiences and provided them with narrations of situations that are commonly and uniquely experienced. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate communications; Employee attitudes; Employee behaviour; Employee relations; Employees involvement; Management attitudes",""

This study expands Job Characteristics Theory (JCT) by using a multilevel approach to predict how variations in motivating job characteristics relate to employee happiness during daily work activities. Based on adaptation level theory and the affective-reactivity hypothesis, we predicted that the positive relationship between perceived motivating job characteristics and happiness during work activities is moderated by motivating job characteristics at the job level and individual differences in trait positive affect. A sample of 68 employees filled out a general survey and reported on their job characteristics and happiness during 741 work activities using a day reconstruction method across five working days. In line with adaptation level theory, multilevel results confirmed that the perceived availability of motivating job characteristics during work activities relates positively to happiness during that same work activity, but only when similar motivating job characteristics at the job level are low. In addition, trait positive affect further moderated this cross-level interaction. In line with the affective-reactivity hypothesis, the 3-way interaction effect showed that for employees who are high in positive affect, the perceived availability of motivating job characteristics related positively to happiness during specific work activities, regardless of whether similar motivating job characteristics at the job level were high or low.

In the United States, the number of hours individuals sleep per night has declined by an hour and a half per night since the 1960s. As of 2005, seventy-four percent of individuals were getting less than eight hours of sleep per night on weekdays. There are negative ramifications to the organization when employees are sleep deprived such as lost productivity, increased accident rate, and increased absenteeism. Originality/Value/Contribution of the paper: Although prior research has investigated the impact that sleep deprivation has on unique job positions (e.g., shift workers, transportation), no research has investigated how sleep impacts business-to-business sales employees. Due to the responsibilities of business-to-business sales employees, this type of position should not just be lumped in with other organizational employees. For example, business-to-business sales employees are boundary spanning employees that are responsible for generating revenue for the organization. These sales employees are also more likely to be physically, socially, and psychologically separated from the organization since they frequently work outside of the office. Because of these distinctive roles, this study examines if differences based on sleep duration exist for business-to-business sales employees for two individual and five organizational factors. The two individual factors consisted of grit and happiness while the five organizational factors consisted of perceived organizational support, perceived supervisory support, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions. Methodology/Approach: Data was collected from 320 business-to-business sales employees using a cross industry survey. The survey was conducted using a Qualtrics panel. Sleep duration was broken into two groups with one group consisting of business-to-business sales employees who sleep, on average, seven or more hours per night and the other group consisting of business-to-business sales employees who sleep, on average, six or less hours per night. The sleep duration groups were determined based on prior research that found adults should regularly sleep seven or more hours per night in order to support optimal health. There were one hundred thirty-four respondents who slept six hours or less and one hundred eighty-six respondents who slept seven or more hours, on average, per night. Findings: The research question developed was answered by examining the differences between means for the two individual constructs and the five key organizational constructs. Differences in sleep duration for six of the seven sales constructs. There were significant differences between those that slept seven or more hours per night from those that slept six or less for grit, perceived organizational support, perceived supervisory support, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions. Results found that business-to-business sales employees that slept seven or more hours per night exhibited more grit than those that slept six or less hours per night. In addition, business-to-business sales employees that slept six or less hours per night had higher perceptions of both organizational and supervisory support than those that slept seven or more hours per night. Furthermore, business-to-business sales employees that slept six or less hours per night displayed higher job satisfaction and organizational commitment than sales employees that slept seven or more hours per night. Finally, business-to-business sales employees that slept seven or more hours per night indicated higher levels of turnover intentions than sales employees that slept six or less hours per night. There were no significant differences between the two sleep groups for sales employee happiness. Although some of these results may appear to be counterintuitive, conservation of resources theory can be used to explain these findings. Research Implications: This exploratory study showcases the importance of good sleep among business-to-business sales employees. This study draws on the conservation of resources theory literature to explain the counterintuitive findings. This theory posits that individuals will retain and guard against resource depletion. Additionally, as resources become depleted, other resources are valued to a greater extent. In this study, the resource being depleted is the condition of sleep. When business-to-business sales employees experience a lower average amount of sleep per night (i.e., six hours or less), they perceive higher levels of support, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment than business-to-business sales employees who experience a higher average amount of sleep per night (i.e., seven hours or more). Although this study provides a good initial examination of how sleep impacts sales organizations, this study also highlights the need for additional business-to-business sales employee sleep research. This is the first study that has examined how sleep duration impacts business-to-business sales employees. Practical Implications: This study is important to sales research because it highlights the impact that poor sleep of business-to-business sales employees has on the organization. For sales organizations, we provide guidance on ways a sales organization can help promote healthy sleep for their business-to-business sales employees. Some examples of guidance provided can be categorized into four primary categories. These categories include (1) proper sleep education, (2) sales management training, (3) creating a sleep friendly workplace environment, and (4) creating specific workplace policies to minimize sleep disturbances such as setting reasonable work hours and sleep accommodating travel schedules. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","grit; job satisfaction; organizational commitment; Sales; sleep; support; turnover intentions",""

The study considered the role of organizational culture as a determinant of internal CSR actions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors questioned 921 employees of companies from various sectors in Spain. The respondents mainly worked for service and industrial companies with fewer than 50 employees and an annual turnover above 250,000 euros. They were mostly men, mainly well-educated and the average age was 38.5. They were surveyed using a questionnaire with 59 questions assessing internal CSR processes (20 items), organizational culture (24 items) and employee happiness (15 items). Findings: The results showed that clan and adhocracy cultures are positively and significantly associated with internal CSR practices. In the case of hierarchy culture, it is positively related to adaptability to change and occupational health and safety. But the results did not support the hypotheses related to market culture as only its relationship with adaptability to change was positive. The data also indicated the significant and positive effect of internal CSR on employee happiness. Originality/value: The authors believe their study has implications for practitioners and policymakers. They argue that organizations should try to develop cultures that help to promote internal CSR, which means adhocracy and clan. Meanwhile, there are also practical implications for researchers. First, the model integrates happiness, which is rare in CSR studies. Second, the study addresses a gap in the research about how company culture acts as an antecedent to internal CSR. Third, the study generates knowledge about internal CSR from the perspective of employees. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adhocracy; Clan; Employee happiness; Internal CSR; Organizational culture",""

A total of 405 respondents who work in local governments in Indonesia participated in an online survey using the snowball sampling technique. Data were analyzed using partial least squares. This study found a significant effect of flexible work arrangements on affective commitment and organizational citizenship behavior. It means that employees perceive a flexible work arrangement policy as an organizational effort to protect employees from Covid-19. Thus, it makes employees showing their affective commitment and willingness to have organizational citizenship behavior. In addition, job satisfaction, organizational citizenship behavior, and work engagement have been shown to affect employee happiness.

Happiness-increasing intentional activities may be cognitive or behavioral. The chapter discusses some of the factors contributing to the success of positive activities and the mechanisms by which they work to increase well-being.

This paper presents a model called Lokman’s Emotion and Importance Quadrant (LEIQ)™, which was built based on axes of emotion vs. importance, to investigate emotion and the importance of the influential factors of the emotion. The paper presents two case studies; i) Employee’s Happiness, ii) Student’s Well-being, with the implementation of LEIQ™ to showcase the process to discover the indicators that affect people’s emotion, and its importance to the people in the effort to provide information to the leaders or management advocates for their strategic decision-making in ensuring well-being and Quality of Life (QoL). Both case studies have enabled the research to understand factors that affect Employee’s Happiness and Student’s Well-being, and how it is important to them.

This article applies these sociological insights to the organizational identifications literature to assess the mechanisms of employee identifications. In this case, there are three mechanisms of identification, a) the organizational value system; b) social relations at work including interactions between employees, the owners and their clients and c) the nature of work.

These uncertainties are reduced by the system design, analysis and implementation effectively by human resources. Human resource management, unlike other operations in the organization is a very sensitive activity and not all the things in HR management can be quantified and spoken in terms of data and numbers. On the other hand, Operations management, in an organization where exact productivity, profit and loss are dealt with in a critical form, should be handled with a system and application that provides proper numbers and data from various operations. Operation management requires technical knowledge about the system in study or implementation, whereas HR management deals with the sensitive human resources as much of the job can’t be quantified such as employee happiness. In many organizations, it is evidently proved that the application of six sigma has led to the visible improvement in the holistic quality of the entire operations as well as individual process. In the initial stages, leaders in HR management were of the opinion that six sigma is principle, that is quite inappropriate towards HR management. After so many deliberations and speculations, many literatures and implementations have proved that six sigma can be ported into HR operations for better efficiency and enhancements in terms of quantifiable aspects. In this research article, we have made a novel move, in integrating the various aspects of Operations management and HR management using six sigma model, that will eventually create an ambience that is conducive for all the human resources to experience in an organization. This framework deals with the integration and analysis of every step towards quality improvement process by six sigma with Operations management and HR management. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication.

Based on the Spillover-Crossover model (SCM), we hypothesize that (a) work-to-family spillover (i.e., work-to-family conflict and facilitation) and (b) employee happiness will sequentially mediate the relationship between parents’ work attitudes and their child’s emotional and behavioral problems. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among Japanese dual-earner couples with pre-school child(ren). On the basis of valid data from 208 families, the hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling. For both fathers and mothers simultaneously, workaholism was positively related to work-to-family conflict, which, in turn, was negatively related to happiness. In contrast, work engagement was positively related to work-to-family facilitation, which, in turn, was positively related to happiness. Fathers’ and mothers’ happiness, in turn, were negatively related to their child’s emotional and behavioral problems. Results suggest that parents’ workaholism and work engagement are related to their child’s emotional and behavioral problems in opposite ways, whereby parents’ spillover and happiness mediate this relationship. These findings support the SCM and suggest that decreasing workaholism and improving work engagement may not only improve employees’ happiness, but also decrease their child’s emotional and behavioral problems. © 2020 by the authors.

In addition, the study has examined the mediating role of employee satisfaction in the relationship between career management policy and job performance, between career development and job performance, and between career information and job performance. Lastly, the moderating role of job security in the relationship between employee satisfaction and job performance was examined. The study offers a perspective that explains the relation between job satisfaction and the level of happiness of employees. Employee happiness levels are also measured by job satisfaction, which fulfils the employee's needs and desires at the workplace. Happiness levels correlate with employee efforts to attain their needs and desires. The intangible variable can be observed and expressed through the emotional feelings; job satisfaction is one of the intangible variables. If the job meets acceptable physiological as well as psychological needs, the level of job satisfaction increases. The current study has filled this gap.

What does it mean? In Denmark, Arbedjsglæde is the most common term which signifies happiness at work. Arbedjsglæde means the happiness that human beings derive on or after doing something. We can say it is a human emotion, a sense of well-being that turns on when one experiences positive about the work they perform and when they feel involved in the professional commitment. When all's said and done 'Happiness' is a highly subjective experience. Happiness and satisfaction are subjective concepts and are not the same. While for some people monetary assistance can be equated with job satisfaction, on the other hand, some might strive for recognition of their hard-work and lose motivation on failing to achieve so. As well as for some people having a friendly work environment is an indispensable requisite for deriving pleasure.

Thus, a survey work through happiness index assessments method has been undertaken by a university to understand its employees’ state of wellbeing. The method accesses the employee happiness index as a mean to understand the employees’ wellbeing state. The process starts by first conducting surveys among the employees. The survey data are indexed by responses to nine respondent profiles attributes, which are campus, type of work, group of work, age, sex, and working duration, duration in the current position, marital status and number of children. They are categorized as independent parameters. Then, the employees’ happiness is assessed through eight working elements which are selected based on PERMAIg © model. The elements are general, positive emotion, engagement, relationship, meaning, accomplishment, infrastructure and gratitude. These profiles are classified as dependent parameters. Next, the relationship patterns between the two parameters need to be identified. Parallel coordinate graph has been found suitable for the relationships discovery. Since the data are big and complex with huge number of parameters, the graph tends cluttering and the relationship patterns are not revealed. Thus, filtering techniques are performed on the graph as a means to extract the relationship patterns.

WFH work engagement was hypothesized to be influenced by WFH autonomy, WFH convenience, and WFH psychosocial safety. All of the constructs were adapted from established scales. Convenience sampling was used for data collection as, under the circumstances, this was the only viable method. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was used for data analysis. Results from this study indicate that WFH work engagement was able to predict a 23.9% variance in perceived happiness, while exogenous constructs, such as WFH autonomy, WFH convenience, and WFH psychosocial safety, were able to predict a 25.2% variance in WFH work engagement. Further f2 effect size (0.313) between WFH work engagement and happiness indicates high effect size.

The study transcends variable and case-level analyses to go beyond prior statistical findings of small-to-medium effect sizes of happiness–performance relationships; the study here identifies antecedent paths involving high-versus-low happy employees associating with high-versus-low managers’ assessments of these employees’ performances. Design/methodology/approach – The study merges data from surveys of employees (n = 247) and surveys completed by their managers (n = 43) and by using qualitative comparative analysis via the software program, fsQCA.com. The study analyzes data from Janfusan Fancyworld, the largest (in revenues and number of employees) tourism business group in Taiwan; Janfusan Fancyworld includes tourist hotels, amusement parks, restaurants and additional firms in related service sectors. Findings – The findings support the four tenets of configural analysis and theory construction: recognize equifinality of different solutions for the same outcome, test for asymmetric solutions, test for causal asymmetric outcomes for very high versus very low happiness and work performance and embrace complexity. Research limitations/implications – Additional research in other firms and additional countries is necessary to confirm the usefulness of examining algorithms for predicting very high (low) happiness and very high (low) quality of work performance. The implications are substantial that configural theory and research will resolve perplexing happiness–performance conundrums. Practical implications – The study provides useful case-level algorithms involving employees’ demographic characteristics and their assessments of work facet-specifics which are useful for explaining very high happiness-at-work and high quality of work performance (as assessed by managers) – as well as algorithms explaining very low happiness and very low quality of work performance. Originality/value – The study is the first to propose and test the tenets of configural theory in the context of hospitality frontline service employees’ happiness-at-work and managers’ assessments of these employees’ quality of work performances. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Complexity theory; Frontline; Happiness; Hospitality management; Hotel and catering management; Human resource management",""

Structural equation modeling was used to test the model. Findings: It was found that the perceptions of AL explain employees’ happiness at work. Perceptions of AL also predict AC both directly and through the mediating effect of happiness at work. Practical implications: The findings suggest that AL predicts happiness at work, which, in turn, explain employees` emotional bond to the organization. These results provide evidence that the quality of working environment created by leaders plays an important role in the extent to which employees develop a better emotional bond at work. So, the organizations, particularly in Cape Verde, should focus on training leaders with authentic characteristics.

We develop various turnover risk models and we compare how different features affect performance prediction. The results show that the top three features that explain turnover risk are: ratio of likes received (likeability), posting frequency (engagement), and relative happiness (employee happiness normalized by company mean).

The current study attempts to answer this question by examining the impact of employee satisfaction trajectories (i.e., systematic changes in employee satisfaction) on customer outcomes. After accounting for employees’ initial satisfaction levels, the analyses demonstrate the importance of employee satisfaction trajectories for customer satisfaction and repatronage intentions, as well as identify customer-employee contact as a necessary conduit for their effect. From a macro perspective, employee satisfaction trajectories strongly impact customer satisfaction for companies with significant employee–customer interaction, but not for companies without such interaction. From a micro perspective, employee satisfaction trajectories influence customer repatronage intentions for frequent customers, but not for infrequent customers. These effects are robust to controlling for previous customer evaluations and recent employee evaluations. Overall, these findings extend the dominant view of examining static, employee satisfaction levels and offer important implications for the management of the organizational frontline. © 2019, Academy of Marketing Science.","Customer satisfaction; Employee satisfaction trajectory; Latent growth curve; Organizational frontline",""

The number of the Romanian companies that are still operating shrinks continuously. The fiscal measures launched by the government empowered in 2012 have not produced the expected effects, as the fiscal authorities locked the bank accounts of the companies that are recoding unpaid debts to the state budget, paralyzing the blood system of the economy. An important effect is also the reduction of the liquidities necessary for the payment of the employees’ wages - which can become a demotivating factor inside the company. In this context, we believe that an analysis of how individuals assign different aspects that make them happy or unhappy at work can provide information on the motivation or lack of motivation of the employees. Our research is based on examining the interviews provided by current and former employees, managers and shareholders of Romanian or foreign owned companies that operate in Romania.

The micro data collection process is different from the big data normally gathered by the state departments in the sense that it is timely, captures the individualized account of happiness which, we recommend, should be correlated with organisational productivity and fed into the overall national statistics on gross national product and public well-being. © 2020, Econjournals.

Some scholars believe that organizations which are able to maintain long-term happiness at the workplace could probably increase and sustain productivity. Therefore, they should know what factors could affect employee happiness in order to effectively enhance happiness at the workplace. But research on employee happiness was rarely seen in the past.

This study aims to understand the past 20 years of research on the topic, also called the holy grail of the organizational sciences, helping to unwrap conclusions so far. Design/methodology/approach: Bibliometric analysis was performed with R statistical tool’s support, complemented by content analysis, based on studies from three major databases between 1999 and 2019. The empirical studies were analyzed according to the constructs used, shedding light on when the happy-productive worker thesis is more likely to be confirmed. Findings: Results show a variety of constructs and instruments used to operationalize the constructs. This lack of convergence accounts for a large part of the general inconclusiveness of the topic. Indicated research gaps can be useful to both academics and practitioners. Research limitations/implications: Only studies declared as related to the happy-productive worker thesis were considered. Practical implications: Managers can benefit from considering the findings as a basis for decision-making regarding investments in employee happiness at work, focusing on the aspects of happy constructs that lead to productive criteria. Originality/value: The application of mixed methods, complementing the bibliometric with thorough content analysis, provided a more detailed overview of current knowledge about the topic, helping to disentangle different concepts that were treated as similar.

Employees’ job satisfaction in a post-COVID-19 scenario is a vital concern for academics and organizations. It is a crucial research question to decipher if employees can proactively rise to challenging job demands and achieve job satisfaction. Also, though the role of job crafting has been studied as an antecedent of job satisfaction, it has not been examined in alliance with job-based psychological ownership (PO). Taking note of this, this study examines the mediating role of job-based PO between seeking challenging job demands (SCJD) and job satisfaction (JS). The study contributes to the growing understanding of post-pandemic employee JS. It provides preliminary empirical evidence of the enabling roles of job-based PO and proactive job crafting in achieving JS. Data for the study were collected from Information Technology (IT) and IT enabled Services (ITeS) sector employees in India using online questionnaires. One hundred eighty-four solicited responses were included in the data analysis and analysed using SPSS and AMOS. Results establish that employees SCJD experience higher job satisfaction. The mediating effect of PO on the association between SCJD and JS has been found. The results have both practical and theoretical implications. This study provides evidence of the beneficiary aspect of proactive employee behaviour. Managers can adopt mechanisms to enable job crafting and ownership. JS can be enhanced by raising the levels of PO and proactive crafting undertaken by SCJD to further learning opportunities at work.

The paper focuses on the means as well as the outcomes of establishing and cultivating a happiness culture. It also helps us in focusing on maintaining happiness at work due to intensified competition and economic uncertainties. Also, its guides us with maintaining happiness at work through different perspectives. Organizations should focus on implementing a culture that takes into consideration the employees' happiness as well as the employees' satisfaction (Frederickson & Branigan, 2005). Management should create efficient communication systems and Job autonomy is another factor that influences job happiness. Institutions with minimum external supervision through democratic leadership, and teamwork increase the self-motivation, and are translated in to happiness at work. Job security is also a factor that influences happiness at work. The job with a longer duration is considered a job with better or higher security, and this enhances the employee's happiness at work (Fredrickson & Branigan, 2005). Happiness at work is the chief cause of exemplary job performance. Employees who are happy at work deliver their best. This is mainly portrayed through the absenteeism from work which seems to be minimal among happy employees. A good number of institutions have a happiness human resource manager whose main duty is to ensure that the employees enjoy doing their work (Cropanzano & Wright, 2001)… Notably, happiness at work ensures emotional stability among the employees. Emotional stability is principal to the employees' health since it ensures that they do not acquire diseases due to stress (Cropanzano & Wright, 2001). Finally, happiness at work influences employee turnover. To some extent, even the unhappy employees seem to conduct their jobs properly because they have no other alternative. Happy employees will often maintain their jobs since their experience at work is pleasant. Happiness at work saves excessive expenditure due to employee retention. It is important for institutions to embrace the virtue of happiness at work. It enhances productivity as well as the employee's well-being. If possible, employers should create departments that focus on employee happiness, thereby raising employee satisfaction for the organization's benefit as well as the employee's well-being. Most of the existing literature work focuses on the problems and barriers at job, while this paper is a unique set of knowledges which enlighten a totally different perspective of increasing efficiency and productivity at work through highlighting the element of Happiness or happy culture at work. © 2017, Society of Petroleum Engineers.","","Empowerment of personnel; Gasoline; Job satisfaction; Productivity; Economic uncertainty; Efficient communications; Emotional stabilities; Employee retention; Employee satisfaction; Employee turnover; Resource managers; Workplace environments; Human resource management"

We examine whether this intriguing psychological effect also occurs for the employees who provide those experiential and material goods to customers.

Furthermore, we hypothesize and find support for a two-step sequential mediation explaining this effect. Experiential (vs. material) jobs are associated with greater employee involvement of the self with the goods they provide to customers and employee perceived positive impact on customers (step 1 mediators), each of which increases job meaningfulness (step 2 mediator), leading to greater job-related happiness. Additionally, as a moderator, we find that when the good turns out negatively for customers, employee involvement of the self with the good and job meaningfulness sequentially mediate the effect, but employee perceived positive impact on customers and job meaningfulness do not.

Will they continue on the same track that, since the nineteenth century, has led them to exert increasing control over their employees? Or will they take another path, one that leads towards a new type of working environment where the culture encourages freedom of communication and movement? This book argues for an approach to employee communication that sets out to liberate employees from the stifling constraints that organisations continue to impose on them. Principled Persuasion is so-called because it uses persuasive techniques, based on clear principles, to create new, forward-looking organisational cultures. It sets out to increase employee happiness and minimise the harms done to employees at work. It grounds itself on a strong ethical base composed of fundamental, universal principles. It introduces a new approach to the use of language, not only calling for more clarity and meaning in organisational communication, but also for a more conscious use of rhetorical techniques to change vocabulary, metaphors and internal dialogue for the better. Make no mistake, most organisations have totally underrated the strategic importance of employee communication. Principled Persuaders understand that the key to dealing with the unpredictable events about to unfold in the twenty-first century will be a new way of communicating with the workforce. The flexibility, adaptability and innovation that will be needed to survive and prosper in coming decades can only be achieved by liberating employees, not imprisoning them further in established systems and processes. © Mike Churchman 2015.","",""

Drawing on theories of humor and emotion, the Wheel Model suggests that humor-induced positive affect results in transmission of emotion to social groups, which in turn creates a climate that supports humor use and subsequent humor events. This model is depicted in a circular pattern to highlight the cumulative and escalatory process through which individual humor events can impact individuals and groups over repeated cycles of the wheel. We also describe individual and environmental variables that are likely to have an impact on relationships within the Wheel Model. Finally, we discuss specific research contexts to which the Wheel Model can be applied (mentoring, leadership, groups/teams), as well as other future research directions. © The Author(s) 2012.","affect; affective events theory; broaden and build; emotional contagion; humor; management; psychology",""

Two hundred and sixteen employees reported their perceptions of OV and their affective well-being (AWB) at work (one of the main indicators of employees' happiness), their supervisors reporting their organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB). The main finding is that the perceptions of OV predict some OCB both directly and through the mediating role of AWB. The evidence suggests that OV is worthy of a higher status in the business and organizational psychology literatures. © Springer 2009.","Affective well-being; Happiness; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Organizational virtuousness; Psychological climate",""

Design/methodology/approach – A case study of flexible working within an NHS Acute Trust is presented. A qualitative study is undertaken based on 43 employee interviews across a range of directorates within the Trust. Findings – Employees perceive that flexible working makes them “happy” and that there are attitudinal/behavioural links between this happiness, discretionary behaviour and a number of performance outcomes. Research limitations/implications – This paper presents a single case study with a relatively small sample which uses an inductive approach based on emergent data; it explores one element of a HPWS rather than an entire employment system. Respondents were volunteers, which raises the possibility of sample bias. Practical implications – There may be a need for organisations to focus more on employee happiness to encourage performance. HR practitioners could reflect on the impact of HR practices on happiness and which features of a job role are likely to promote happiness. Originality/value – This paper contributes a much-needed employee perspective on the effect of HR practices, specifically that of flexible working, and explores the neglected employee attitude of happiness. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Attitudes; Flexible working hours; Individual behaviour; Performance management",""

Decades of research have been unable to establish a strong link between workplace happiness and performance. A variation on the enduring employee happiness-productivity debate is evolving the ""happy-performing managers"" proposition. Design/methodology/ approach - An empirical investigation reports on the impact of two important aspects of job happiness - self-rated affective wellbeing and intrinsic job satisfaction - on superiors' ratings of managers' contextual and task performance. An ancillary methodological objective of the study is to establish the structure of managers' performance. Findings - A partial model of managers' affective wellbeing, intrinsic job satisfaction and performance contributed an understanding to how specific indicators of affective wellbeing and intrinsic job satisfaction predict certain dimensions of managers' performance. Practical implications - Changes in the workplace emphasises are needed to ensure managers can retain and improve their positive affective wellbeing by working smarter and faster, rather than harder and longer. Originality/value - A contribution of this paper is to provide qualified support for the ""happy-performing managers"" proposition by linking the conceptual bases relating to managers' affective wellbeing, intrinsic job satisfaction and to their performance. These findings progress the debate as to how work might be structured to improve managers' affective wellbeing and consequently their performance. Perhaps, it is timely to consider moving away from the negative forms of psychology and affirm managers' future by embracing the ""happy-performing managers"" proposition. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Employee productivity; Job satisfaction; Managers; Productivity rate","anxiety; article; employee attitude; happiness; human; job analysis; job performance; job satisfaction; job stress; manager; mental health; organizational structure; outcome assessment; personnel management; priority journal; productivity; task performance; wellbeing; workplace"

Harpaz and Meshoulam (2004) note that people deem work more important than leisure, community, and religion. In several studies, work was ranked second only to family (Harding & Hikspoors, 1995; Harpaz, 1990; MOW-International Research Team, 1987; Harpaz & Meshoulam, 2009). The workplace also plays a crucial role in helping individuals achieve and maintain their self-esteem, status, and sense of accomplishment (Harpaz, 1990; Snir & Harpaz, 2002b; Snir & Harpaz, 2004). Organizational scholars have found that work can be a source of happiness (Judge & Kammeyer-Mueller, 2011). The great importance of the work domain, combined with opportunities for actualization in the workplace, has caused many individuals to work excessively and invest long hours in their jobs. The term “workaholism”, coined by Oates (1971), is now commonplace in daily language to express employees’ heavy work investment in their jobs (Harpaz & Snir, 2003; McMillan, Brady, O’Driscoll, & Marsh, 2002; Snir & Harpaz, 2012). Burke (2000a) notes the ongoing debate on the association between heavy work investment and personal well-being, and the lack of consensus as to whether the relationship between these two variables is positive or negative. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","",""

Two survey questionnaires were developed for the study, one targeting non-managerial employees and the other targeting senior managers. Two random samples of non-managerial employees (n=263) and senior managers (n=76) attached fulltime to globally distributed software development firms in Sri Lanka responded. For the data analysis, descriptive statistics, factor analysis, analysis of variance, and multiple regression were used. It was found that reduction in financial rewards, reduction in benefits, and training and development provision significantly vary by the size of the firm. Further, the communication of information, performance management, reduction in financial rewards, and reduction in benefits significantly predict employees' happiness at work during recession. The research was designed as a cross-sectional study employing survey methodology. Respondent senior managers were reluctant to provide actual data on layoffs and quits during the recession period. The findings of this study would contribute for practitioners to better understand the HRM practices adopted by the firms during recession and effects of these HRM practices on employees' level of happiness at work. Employees' happiness by doing what is worth doing, pursing important goals, and using one's skills and talents during the economic recession could be affected by the HRM practices adopted during the recession. It is evident that firms facing economic recession launch cost reduction initiatives such as pay cuts and freeze in new hires. From the academic and practical standpoint it is important to identify the influence of such HRM practices adopted during the recession on employees' happiness at work. However, available research does not provide sufficient understanding about the influence of HRM practices on employees' happiness at work during recession as empirical research on this area is presently lacking. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Employees behaviour; Globally distributed software development; Happiness at work; Human resource management; Human resource management practices; Recession; Sri Lanka",""

In particular, many have been fascinated by the happy/productive worker thesis. According to this hypothesis, happy employees exhibit higher levels of job-related performance behaviors than do unhappy employees. However, despite decades of research, support for the happy/productive worker thesis remains equivocal. These inconsistent findings primarily result from the variety of ways in which happiness has been operationalized. Most typically, organizational theorists have operationalized happiness as job satisfaction, as the presence of positive affect, as the absence of negative affect, as the lack of emotional exhaustion, and as psychological well being. I will review this literature using the circumplex framework as the taxonomic guideline. In addition, drawing on the impetus of the ""positive psychology"" movement, I propose Fredrickson's (1998, 2001, 2003) broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions as one approach especially well-suited for future research to better understand the happy/productive worker thesis. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
